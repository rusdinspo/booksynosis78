<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State (Princeton Classics, 76)</h2><p><p>The modern state, however we conceive of it today, is based on a pattern that emerged in Europe in the period from 1100 to 1600. Inspired by a lifetime of teaching and research, <i>On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State</i> is a classic work on what is known about the early history of the European state. This short, clear book book explores the European state in its infancy, especially in institutional developments in the administration of justice and finance. Forewords from Charles Tilly and William Chester Jordan demonstrate the perennial importance of Joseph Strayer's book, and situate it within a contemporary context. Tilly demonstrates how Strayer&#x2019;s work has set the agenda for a whole generation of historical analysts, not only in medieval history but also in the comparative study of state formation. William Chester Jordan's foreword examines the scholarly and pedagogical setting within which Strayer produced his book, and how this both enhanced its accessibility and informed its focus on peculiarly English and French accomplishments in early state formation.</p></p><p><b>Joseph R. Strayer</b> (1904&#x2013;87) was the Dayton-Stockton Professor of History Emeritus at Princeton University. His books include <i>The Middle Ages, Western Europe in the Middle Ages,</i> and <i>Feudalism</i>. <b>Charles Tilly</b> (1929&#x2013;2008) was the Joseph L. Buttenwieser Professor of Social Science at Columbia University. <b>William Chester Jordan</b> is professor of history at Princeton University. He is the author of <i>From England to France: Felony </i>and<i> Exile in the High Middle Ages</i> (Princeton)."Precise, well-documented. . . . [<i>On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State</i>] is full of essential matter about how states as we know them came into being, and is particularly good on the root questions. . . . How and why did states begin to imagine themselves as sovereign? And: how does a policy maker get a bureaucracy to follow through?" (<i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>"[Strayer] brilliantly traces the developments of the modern state from the medieval kingdoms of Europe." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"A distinguished book. . . . The elegant and fastidious style should not blind the reader to the lifetime of learning; in some ways the book is deceptively simple, but actually it is a profound and carefully thought out treatise."

Four of the stories are by Miguel de Unamuno, the spiritual leader of the Generation of 1898. Among the other authors included here. Ram�n del Valle-Incl�n was a chief representative of <i>modernismo</i> fiction. Vicente Blasco Ib��ez, one of the best-known of these writers (though not usually regarded as an authentic 98er), was a keen observer of peasant life. P�o Baroja, sometimes called the foremost Spanish novelist of the twentieth century, wrote a virile, unadorned prose whose style is reputed to have influenced Hemingway. And "Azor�n" (Jos� Martinez Ruiz), represented here with a short novel, has an impressionistic and elliptical style that has been described as a literary counterpart to abstract painting.<br>This dual-language edition features an informative introduction and ample footnotes, making it not only a pleasure to read but also a valuable learning and teaching aid for students and teachers of Spanish literature.</p><p></p><h2>Little Women (Collins Classics)</h2><p><p>HarperCollins is proud to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics.</p><p>'Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true and we could live in them?'</p><p>A heart-warming tale of love, sisterhood and hardship during the New England Civil War, Little Women tells the story of the lovable March family. Meg, Beth, Jo and Amy try to support their mother at home while their father is away at war and enter into various scrapes and adventures as they do so.

Largely based on the author's own childhood, <i>Little Women</i> is a timeless tale of the four young March sisters&#x2014;Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy&#x2014;who grow to maturity in their mother's tender but strong care. As different in their personalities as they are alike in their devotion to each other, the girls vow to support their beloved mother, Marmee, by behaving their best while Father is away, serving as an army chaplain in the Civil War.<br>Literary-minded tomboy Jo develops a fast friendship with the boy next door, and pretty Meg, the eldest, finds romance; frail and affectionate Beth fills the house with music, and little Amy, the youngest, seeks beauty with all the longing of an artist's soul.

While leadership has been studied within all the major social sciences, Barling mainly focuses on findings from psychological research. The first part of the book explains the nature of organizational leadership, responds to the question of whether leaders "matter," and explains how leadership works. A longstanding issue is whether leadership can be taught. Barling explores the debate over whether leadership is "born or made" as well as the effectiveness of leadership development interventions in organizations. He gives consideration to what can be learned from leadership in other contexts such as sports, the political arena, and schools, and devotes individual chapters to topics that include gender and leadership, destructive leadership, and followership.<br></p><p><br>Julian Barling is the Borden Chair of Leadership and Queens Research Chair at the Queen's School of Business. Barling is extensively involved in research, graduate teaching, and executive development focused on organizational leadership, and has received numerous awards for research and teaching. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2002, and is a Fellow of the Society of Industrial and Organizational Psychology, the Association for Psychological Science, and the Canadian Psychological Society.<br><br>"Do leaders matter? Are leaders born or made? <em>The Science of Leadership</em> focuses on the psychology of leadership. Findings from psychological research enable an evidence-based approach that explores global research in organisational leadership. Barling incorporates personal reflections based on 20 years' involvement with leadership research and executive leadership development. The book translates leadership theories and research into everyday behaviours, and explains how researchers generate knowledge on leadership. Barling explores what leadership can teach us beyond the boardroom, for example, in sports, politics, and schools. Separate chapters cover topics including gender and leadership, destructive leadership, and followship." --<em>WITSReview</em><p></p><br>"There's no shortage of books on leadership, and this book's purpose is 'to bridge the gap between academic and trade books, by focusing on what is actually known about organizational leadership from the enormous body of scientifically driven research.' It's written in a way that is accessible to those who want to use this knowledge to guide their everyday behaviors and for practitioners that want to use it design leadership programs. The book offers a thorough history of leadership theory and the data to support where leadership development initiatives have had success. This is a must read for human resource and leadership development practitioners to understand what we know and still are investigating around leadership." -Laura Schwarz, <em>i2leadership.com</em><p></p><br>"Barling, an organizational behavior professor at Canada's Queen's University, explores some central debates about leadership -- whether leaders are born or made, the relevance of gender, the import of followership -- by reference to mostly psychological research conducted over the past two decades. The result is an accessible and frequently illuminating tour of the evidence shaping and underlying popular if often superficial debates. Perhaps most directly relevant to many readers will be the question (and layered answer) about the effectiveness of leadership development programs." -David Slocum, <em>Forbes</em><p></p><br>"[<em>The Science of Leadership</em>] was immediately applicable and helpful in developing an understanding of the real life issues that confront leaders. Barling has done a great service to the field by addressing some of the most important topics confronting the study of leadership. What makes the book so interesting to read is that the author offers an in-depth exploration of topics that are often neglected in books on leadership. Many readers will find this refreshing, interesting, and accessible." --Clive Fullagar, <em>Personnel Psychology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Evaluating Software Architectures: Methods and Case Studies</h2><p>The foundation of any software system is its architecture, this text is intended to help architects determine what aspects of their architectures need improvement. The techniques put forward are based on actual practice in both government and industry development organizations.</p><p><p> <b>Praise for <i>Evaluating Software Architectures </i> </b> </p><p>&#x201c;The architecture of complex software or systems is a collection of hard decisions that are very expensive to change. Successful product development and evolution depend on making the right architectural choices. Can you afford not to identify and not to evaluate these choices? The authors of this book are experts in software architecture and its evaluation. They collected a wealth of ideas and experience in a well-organized and accessible form. If you are involved in the development of complex systems or software, you will find this book an invaluable guide for establishing and improving architecture evaluation practice in your organization.&#x201d; </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Alexander Ran</b>, Principal Scientist of Software Architecture, Nokia <p>&#x201c;Software engineers must own this book. It is a well-written guide to the steps for evaluating software architecture. It argues for the inclusion of architecture evaluation and review as a standard part of the software development lifecycle. It introduces some new and innovative methods for analyzing important architecture characteristics, like extensibility, portability, and reliability. I believe these methods will become new engineering cornerstones for creating good software systems.&#x201d; </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Joe Maranzano</b>, AT&amp;T Bell Labs Fellow in Software Architecture (1990), and former head of the Bell Labs Software Technology Center <p>&#x201c;Experience and teamwork are the only approaches I know of to deliver products faster, cheaper, and yet to delight your customers. In their first book, <i>Software Architecture in Practice</i>, Paul and Rick (and Len Bass) helped me match my experience with theory. Their invaluable approaches and case studies changed my practice and the way I proceed to design systems and software architectures. This second book, with Mark, covers what I will look at before I feel good about an architecture. It is about how I can tap other people's experience to produce an improved outcome, using other people's feedback. I have used many of the concepts explained in this book for my customers' benefit. Using this book, you&#x2014;architects, developers, and managers&#x2014;will develop a common language and practice to team up and deliver more successful products.&#x201d; </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Bertrand Salle</b>, lead architect with a major telecommunications company <p>&#x201c;If architecture is the foundation of system construction, architectural evaluation is part of the foundation of getting to a &#x2018;good&#x2019; architecture. In this book, the authors put their considerable expertise to one of the most pressing issues in systems development today: how to evaluate an architecture prior to system construction to ascertain its feasibility and suitability to the system of interest. The book provides a practical guide to architecture evaluation using three contemporary evaluation methods. It should prove valuable to practitioners and as a basis for the evolution of architectural evaluation as an engineering practice.&#x201d; </p> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Rich Hilliard</b>, Chief Technical Officer, ConsentCache, Inc., and technical editor, <i>IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software-Intensive Systems </i> <p>&#x201c;Too many systems have performance and other problems caused by an inappropriate architecture. Thus problems are introduced early, but are usually detected too late&#x2014;when the deadline is near or, even worse, after the problem makes the headlines. Remedies lead to missed schedules, cost overruns, missed market windows, damaged customer relations, and many other difficulties. It is easy to prevent these problems by evaluating the architecture choices early, and selecting an appropriate one.&#x201d; </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Connie U.

Why use the ATAM to evaluate an architecture? Mitigation of design risk is a major reason, but more importantly, the ATAM provides an interactive vehicle that can give key development and user stakeholders architectural visibility&#x2014;visibility that can lead to an important &#x2018;early buy-in.&#x2019;&#x201d; </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Rich Zebrowski</b>, Software Technology Manager, Motorola, Inc. <p>&#x201c;Caterpillar's experience with architecture reviews includes SAAM, ATAM, ARID, and ADR evaluation methods described in this book, the first three in detail. These reviews ensured that the needs of the user community were being met, and they exposed the architecture to others in the organization helping with understanding and organizational buy-in. The SAAM- and ATAM-based evaluations worked well to expose the architecture early in the development cycle to a broad range of people. The ARID- and ADR-based evaluations facilitated the exposure of technical details of the architecture later in the development cycle. As the architect of the pilot project for ARID, I observed that this review even served as an architecture training session before the architecture was fully documented.&#x201d; </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Lee R.

The ATAM techniques described in this book give technical managers, system architects, and engineers proven tools for breaking down the communications barriers that impede our ability to realize these goals. We have successfully integrated the ATAM techniques throughout our lifecycle, including development and maintenance, and have found that they provide the strong technical basis we need to evaluate the many difficult trades required by a system as large as EOSDIS.&#x201d; </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Mike Moore</b>, Deputy Manager, Science Systems Development Office, Earth Observing System Data Information System (EOSDIS) Project, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center <p>&#x201c;If you know how difficult architecture reviews are, you will be amazed how effective ATAM evaluations can be.

M. Forster's <i>Where Angels Fear to Tread</i> focuses on a group of English men and women living and traveling in Italy. A young Englishman journeys to Tuscany to rescue his late brother's wife from what appears to be an unsuitable romance with an Italian of little fortune. In the events surrounding that match and its fateful consequences, Forster weaves an exciting and eventful tale that intriguingly contrasts English and Italian lives and sensibilities. <br>As in Forster novels, among them <i>Howards End</i> and <i>A Passage to India, Where Angels Fear to Tread</i> reveals the author's deep fascination with all of human experience &#x2014; sexual, moral, spiritual, imaginative, material. Acutely observant of the ways of the English middle class, he is as critical here of its snobbishness, greed, and cultural insensitivity as he is respectful of its decency and kindness, common sense, and goodwill. This splendid novel reveals the great breadth of his gifts as both storyteller and humanist &#x2014; attributes that continue to make him one of the twentieth century's most admired novelists.</p><p>6 1-hour cassettes"Let her go to Italy!" he cried. "Let her meddle with what she doesn't understand! Look at this letter! The man who wrote it will marry her, or murder her, or do for her somehow. He's a bounder, but he's not an English bounder. He's mysterious and terrible. He's got a country behind him that's upset people from the beginning of the world." <br>When a young English widow takes off on the grand tour and along the way marries a penniless Italian, her in-laws are not amused. That the marriage should fail and poor Lilia die tragically are only to be expected. But that Lilia should have had a baby -- and that the baby should be raised as an Italian! -- are matters requiring immediate correction by Philip Herriton, his dour sister Harriet, and their well-meaning friend Miss Abbott. <br>In his first novel, E. M. Forster anticipated the themes of cultural collision and the sterility of the English middle class that he would develop in A Room with a View and A Passage to India. Where Angels Fear to Tread is an accomplished, harrowing, and malevolently funny book, in which familiar notions of vice and virtue collapse underfoot and the best intentions go mortally awry.</p><h2>Tantric Massage: An Illustrated Manual for Meditative Sexuality</h2><p>With more than one hundred erotic drawings and a full-color insert, <b>Erotic Massage</b> provides easy-to-learn strokes and methods that allow you and your partner to bring together the sensual, the erotic, and the intimate. <p>The detailed illustrations and instructions can be easily absorbed in one evening so that sensual techniques of <b>Erotic Massage</b> can be enjoyed immediately.

Tolkien's beloved classic&#x2014;just in time for the December 2012 release of Peter Jackson's new film adaptation, <i>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</i></b> <p>J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>The Hobbit</i> is one of the best-loved fantasy books of all time and the enchanting "prequel" to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. With the help of some of history's great philosophers, this book ponders a host of deep questions raised in this timeless tale, such as: Are adventures simply "nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things" that "make you late for dinner," or are they exciting and potentially life-changing events? What duties do friends have to one another?

How should Smaug's treasure have been distributed? Did Thorin leave his "beautiful golden harp" at Bag-End when he headed out into the Wild? (If so, how much could we get for that on eBay?)</li> <li>Draws on the insights of some of the world's deepest thinkers, from Confucius, Plato, and Aristotle to Immanuel Kant, William Blake, and contemporary American philosopher Thomas Nagel</li> </ul> <p>From the happy halls of Elrond's Last Homely House to Gollum's "slimy island of rock,"&nbsp;this is a must read for longtime Tolkien fans as well as those discovering Bilbo Baggins and his adventures "there and back again" for the first time.</p></p><p><p><b>Amazon.com Author Exclusive: Bassham and Bronson Talking Hobbits, Philosophy, and Peter Jackson</b></p> <p><b>Bassham</b>: Although New Line Cinema&#x2019;s <i>The Hobbit</i> is coming after the success of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote <i>The Hobbit</i> first. Of course, Bilbo finds the magic ring, the dragon&#x2019;s treasure is recovered, and greed begins to grow in many of the main characters in the story. What other philosophical issues posed in <i>The Hobbit</i> get developed later in the <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>? </p> <p><b>Bronson</b>: One of the great themes to emerge from Tolkien&#x2019;s Middle-earth is what it means to go on an &#x201c;adventure.&#x201d; So much of Frodo&#x2019;s adventure to destroy the ring in Mordor is developed from Bilbo&#x2019;s adventure to slay the dragon on the Lonely Mountain. Both uncle and nephew go through serious personal changes as they confront danger. These confrontations are much more challenging than simply staying at home, enjoying some ale and a good smoke. Consistently, Tolkien tells us that change can be a good thing and that we can grow through confronting challenges and adventures. But what separates Tolkien from so many self-help authors today is his understanding that change and maturation can also be troubling. Lost innocence has its costs, and not everybody grows when confronted by pressures or adversity. Just ask Saruman or Denethor. Or Nietzsche. </p> <p><b>Bassham</b>: What makes <i>The Hobbit</i> different from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>? </p> <p><b>Bronson</b>: Well, one of the biggest differences between <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>The Hobbit</i> is the tone. Right from the opening line we understand <i>The Hobbit</i> is meant to appeal to children. All the life and death battles in the book are meant to fascinate readers, not frighten us. I wouldn&#x2019;t say <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is humorless, but its themes are certainly darker. And darker themes always appeal to philosophers. That said, we shouldn&#x2019;t be too easily seduced by the elves, dwarves, and humans that populate <i>The Hobbit</i>. Having fun can be serious business. The ancient Greeks understood the connection between play and education. Philosophers from Aristotle to Elmo have taught us that developing our imagination requires a sense of humor and uninterrupted leisure time. In the age of humorless machines, this theme was very important to Tolkien. He believed combatting the sour-faced goblins of Modernity was also important. </p> <p><b>Bassham</b>: Why do you think Tolkien&#x2019;s tales of Middle-earth are so popular today? </p> <p><b>Bronson</b>: We&#x2019;re very attracted to magical worlds, particularly those that hearken back to simpler times and invoke classic virtues, such as courage, honor, and loyalty. So much of popular culture, from <i>Harry Potter</i> to <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, owes a debt to Middle-earth. But Tolkien was also suspicious of magic if it meant manipulating the natural world for the sake of power or control. Stealth bombers and heat-seeking missiles can create that kind of &#x201c;magic.&#x201d; Enchantment and artistry were more interesting themes to Tolkien. Creating credible and highly developed alternate worlds that delight and instruct isn&#x2019;t easy. Tolkien was the master, the fountainhead of an entire genre. When works of fantasy inspire us to imagine different worlds, we see our own world with fresh eyes and perceive the wonder in everyday things. And that, I think, is a very good thing. </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p>J.R.R.

It is a perfect likeness of the quite extraordinarily beautiful young man, and prompts him to make a mad wish for eternal youth.<br><br>In the years to come, he devotes his public life to art and aestheticism&#x2013;and his private one to decadence and debauchery. And while his gilded youth remains intact, the picture of Dorian Gray, long banished to the attic, mirrors the hideous corruption of hi soul. His wish has come true&#x2013;but it has its consequences. <br><br><b><i>The most comprehensive paperback edition available, with introduction, notes, selected criticism and chronology of Wilde's life and times.</i></b></p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>Loose Leaf for Wardlaw&#39;s Perspectives in Nutrition: A Functional Approach</h2><p><b><i>Welcome to one-stop shopping for everything you need for your introductory majors course!

Small and as old as time itself, he brings back the past for them to witness. He re-creates a Roman centurion, a Renaissance craftsman and the villages of time gone by.</p><p>Puck of Pook&#39;s Hill and Rewards and Fairies are classic children&#39;s books which speak powerfully to adult readers. Una and Dan, performing a scene from A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream one Midsummer&#39;s Eve, accidentally summon Puck to a fairy ring near their Sussex home. Through Puck the children are witnesses to tales of English history, subtly called forth by Kipling&#39;s brilliant and fluid adventure writing. Kipling&#39;s historical imagination extends to a wide variety of stories, many of which blend the ghostly and the familiar, and often anticipate his later writing in their themes: a sense of loss and breakdown, but also healing. First published in magazines between 1906 and 1910, the stories were accompanied by some of Kipling&#39;s most famous poems, including &#39;If-&#39; and &#39;The Way through the Woods&#39;. This edition includes an introduction which dispels the myth that these stories are simply a nostalgic view of English history, discusses their relationship to other historical fiction, and relates them to Kipling&#39;s earlier and later writings.<b>Rudyard Kipling</b> was born in Bombay in 1865. During his time at the United Services College, he began to write poetry, privately publishing <b>Schoolboy Lyrics</b> in 1881. The following year he started work as a journalist in India, and while there produced a body of work, stories, sketches, and poems including Mandalay, Gunga Din, and Danny Deeverwhich made him an instant literary celebrity when he returned to England in 1889. While living in Vermont with his wife, an American, Kipling wrote <b>The Jungle Books</b>, <b>Just So Stories</b>, and <b>Kim</b>which became widely regarded as his greatest long work, putting him high among the chronicles of British expansion. Kipling returned to England in 1902, but he continued to travel widely and write, though he never enjoyed the literary esteem of his early years. In 1907, he became the first British writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize. He died in 1936</p><h2>Atlas of Anatomy</h2><p>Take a journey inside the mysterious world of our body, through pages of beautiful and detailed anatomical images. Analysis and summaries throughout the text will allow us to study the human body, from its posture and bipedal walk, to the development of the brain and speech and of those anatomical structures that characterize us and distinguish us from animals. Following this, other organs are discussed, including the elements that characterize them. Each topic is connected to another through a network of &#34;references&#34; which allow us to skip from one to the next as if it was a hypertext. We believe that this structure is the best way to learn and understand anatomy and the human body. It is, in fact, the transversal way of &#34;reading &#34;the body, which evokes the profound inter-relations between the components of this wonderful &#34;organic machine&#34; called the body. As a result, a wider range of topics is covered that deviate somewhat from a traditional anatomical book. Some of these topics include the study of the history of anatomy, an overview of the technology applied to the study of the human body, the functional mechanisms of the body systems, and the primary medical issues and complications relative to each apparatus. This book extremely useful to the entire family, for those who are curious to learn more about their body and want to know how it works. It is easy to use, serving also as a quick reference manual.</p><p></p><h2>Adapted Physical Activity, Recreation, and Sport: Crossdisciplinary and Lifespan</h2><p>Offering the most comprehensive coverage available and broadening the audience scope to include students majoring in exercise science or coaching who are preparing for nonteaching positions, this new edition features a lifespan, cross-disciplinary approach valuable for both teaching and non-teaching professionals. <i>Adapted Physical Activity, Recreation, and Sport</i> emphasizes attitude change, inclusion, and psychosocial perspectives for understanding individual differences.</p><p>Dr. Claudine Sherrill is internationally known for her pioneer work in adapted physical activity, physical education teacher education, psychosocial perspectives of disability, inclusion, and social justice.

Inaccessible and unknown to most New Yorkers, the structures and machinery captured in Stanley Greenberg's luminous black-and-white prints deliver the essential services that a city's inhabitants usually take for granted. Many of these vast and imposing facilities have in recent decades been neglected or fallen into disuse. Others remain intact and in continuous use. Greenberg's dark and poetic images document how a city works, its technological evolution since the 19th century, and the toll that deterioration and years of deferred maintenance can take on the soul of a city.</p><p>With a 4 x 5 monorail view camera and using only available light, Greenberg photographed sites in all five of New York's boroughs, many now permanently sealed in the interests of national security. Among the invisible places recorded are the massive valve chambers in the water tunnels 300 feet underground and other features of New York's extraordinary water system; the anchorages of the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Verrazano Narrows bridges; the dry dock at the Brooklyn Navy Yard; the derelict power station at Floyd Bennett Field; the elegant, turn-of-the-century steam turbine in Brooklyn's Pratt Institute; crumbling ruins on Ellis Island and Roosevelt Island; hidden sections of Grand Central Station and the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine; the West Side rail yards in Manhattan; the secret Nike missile silos in the Bronx; one of the last remaining manual switch rooms in the New York subway system; the faded grandeur of the City Hall Subway Station, its bronze chandeliers and leaded glass ceilings still largely undamaged; and the vast Brooklyn Army Terminal, once the world's largest warehouse.</p><p>Greenberg's photographs of this hidden city uncover long-forgotten engineering feats, magnificent examples of skilled craftsmanship, and fascinating clues about New York's industrial past, as well as reveal the increasing aesthetic apathy of today's builders. His images chronicle both the beauty and the banal necessity of this rich legacy, threatened by public ignorance and bureaucratic indifference. <i>Invisible New York</i> offers a unique perspective on one of the world's great cities and alerts us to the hidden sites and essential facilities found in all cities which are slowly and secretly decaying or disappearing. </p></p><p>There are many surprises among the 53 black-and-white photographs in Stanley Greenberg's hymn to the hum of the city that never sleeps. There is a revealing shot of the roof structure above the curved vault of Grand Central Station's night-sky ceiling that shows where those light bulbs are screwed in to form the delicate constellations commuters see every day. The anchorages of several city bridges--the chambers where the powerful cables that hold up the roadways are fastened down--are exposed to view, peeling paint, trash, and all. There is a gleaming shot of a working Con Edison turbine and a cluttered view of a derelict power station at Floyd Bennett Field, the city's first municipally owned commercial airport.<p> The pictures possess a certain sameness after the first 20 or so, but New York has been immortalized by many of history's very best photographers, so Greenberg has a tough act to follow. He has good company as he searches for a new angle, however, including Laura Rosen, whose <i>Manhattan Shores</i> is an equally quirky but richly satisfying and illuminating trek around the edges of the island, and Horst Hamann, whose <i>New York Vertical</i> has become an instant classic. Anyone who likes the idea of exploring the city's underpinnings instead of the subways, piers, or buildings themselves will love <i>Invisible New York</i>, which also contains an index in which Greenberg imparts fascinating information about each site. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p><p>Remarkable photographs of a New York even long-time residents have never seen.</p></p><h2>Soft Subversions, new edition: Texts and Interviews 1977-1985 (Semiotext(e) / Foreign Agents)</h2><p><p><b>A new, expanded, and reorganized edition of a collection of texts that present a fuller scope to Guattari's thinking from 1977 to 1985.</b></p><p>This new edition of Soft Subversions expands, reorganizes, and develops the original 1996 publication, offering a carefully organized arrangement of essays, interviews, and short texts that present a fuller scope to Guattari's thinking from 1977 to 1985. This period encompasses what Guattari himself called the &#x201c;Winter Years&#x201d; of the early 1980s&#x2015;the ascent of the Right, the spread of environmental catastrophe, the rise of a disillusioned youth with diminished prospects for career and future, and the establishment of a postmodernist ideology that offered solutions toward adaptation rather than change&#x2015;a period with discernible echoes twenty years later. Following Semiotext(e)'s release last season of the new, expanded edition of Chaosophy: Texts and Interviews 1972&#x2013;1977, this book makes Guattari's central ideas and concepts fully available in the format that had been best suited to Guattari's temperament: the guerrilla-styled intervention of the short essay and interactive dialogue.

Born to the second of her father's seven wives in rural Afghanistan, Fawzia Koofi's mother&#x2015;who had hoped for a son&#x2015;left her to die in the sun after birth. But despite a childhood of abuse and deprivation in a notoriously sexist society, she rose above her fate to become the first female Speaker of Parliament. Along the way, she faced the murders of her father, brother, and husband, and numerous attempts on her life. Here, she shares her amazing story, punctuated by a series of poignant letters she wrote to her two daughters before each political trip&#x2015;letters describing the future and freedoms she dreamed of for them and all their countrywomen. This eloquent memoir pleads for the world to recognize the politically devastating consequences if a frustrated American military relinquishes the country to the Taliban, undoing all the fragile progress of recent years.</p><p><p><b>Fawzia Koofi</b> is Afghanistan's first female Parliament speaker and a noted activist for women's and children's rights.

Of special interest is the inclusion of readings from the earliest translation of the <i>Book Of Job</i>, the recently published Targum (Aramaic translation) recovered from Cave XI of Khirbet Qumran, in the Judean Wilderness near the Dead Sea, perhaps the version which was suppressed by Rabbi Gamaliel.<br><br>The <i>Book Of Job</i> is one of the indisputably great works of world literature. The story is well-known: a prosperous and happy man, distinguished for rectitude and piety, falls victim to a series of catastrophes. And the occasion (if not the reason) for these undeserved calamities: Satan's challenge to Yahweh to test the sincerity of Job's faith.<br><br>It is by now proverbial to refer to the patience of Job. Yet this traditional image derives only from the Prologue and the Epilogue of the book. But the Job who confronts us in the long middle section is anything but patient. His outcries against God raise the question of theodicy, or divine justice, which occupies the greater portion of Job's Dialogue with his comforters.<br><br>But it is inevitably as literature that <i>Job</i> must be read and enjoyed. This translation is marked by a concerted effort to capture as much as possible the poetic and metrical characteristics of the original Hebrew: the result is a version notable for its accuracy and directness. The experience of reading the <i>Book Of Job</i> in this translation, then, is to rediscover an exceedingly eloquent masterpiece. In the terse, rhythmic quality of the translation, the incisive comprehensiveness of the introduction and notes, <i>Job</i> maintains the high standard of scholarship, literateness, and readability established in The Anchor Bible.</p><p></p><h2>Simplified Design of Steel Structures</h2><p>For over sixty years, a primary source for design of steel structures -- now revised and updated. <p>Examining a wide range of steel structures, building types, and construction details, <i>Simplified Design of Steel Structures, Eighth Edition</i> is a reliable, easy-to-use handbook that covers all commonly used steel systems, practices, and research in the field, reinforced with examples of practical designs and general building structural systems.</p> <p>The Eighth Edition of this leading book in the noted Parker/Ambrose Series of Simplified Design Guides has been updated to conform to current building codes, design practices, and industry standards.

Flanked on four sides by rivals, it possessed few of the advantages that explain successful empires. Its army was not renowned for offensive prowess, its finances were often shaky, and its populace was fragmented into more than a dozen ethnicities. Yet somehow Austria endured, outlasting Ottoman sieges, Frederick the Great, and Napoleon. <i>The Grand Strategy of the Habsburg Empire</i> tells the story of how this cash-strapped, polyglot empire survived for centuries in Europe's most dangerous neighborhood without succumbing to the pressures of multisided warfare.</p><p>Taking readers from the War of the Spanish Succession in the early 1700s to the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, A. Wess Mitchell argues that the Habsburgs succeeded not through offensive military power or great wealth but by developing strategies that manipulated the element of time in geopolitical competition. Unable to fight all their enemies at once, the Habsburgs learned to use the limited tools at their disposal&#x2015;terrain, technology, and treaty allies&#x2015;to sequence and stagger their conflicts, drive down the costs of empire, and concentrate scarce resources against the greatest threat of the moment. Rarely holding a grudge after war, they played the "long game" in geopolitics, corralling friend and foe alike into voluntarily managing the empire's lengthy frontiers and extending a benign hegemony across the turbulent lands of middle Europe.</p><p>A study in adaptive statecraft, <i>The Grand Strategy of the Habsburg Empire</i> offers lessons on how to navigate a messy geopolitical map, stand firm without the advantage of military predominance, and prevail against multiple rivals.</p></p><p><p>"In this very accomplished book, A. Wess Mitchell shows how the Habsburgs successfully managed and outlasted numerous great power challenges across multiple fronts and with limited resources--and how the Habsburg model can usefully inform American strategy today. A worthy contribution to existing literature on the grand strategies of historic great powers."<b>--Colin Dueck, author of <i>The Obama Doctrine: American Grand Strategy Today</i></b></p><p>"A. Wess Mitchell demonstrates how the Habsburg Empire, a multiethnic power made up of a host of independent polities, managed to endure despite grievous threats on every frontier. It is through the study of exemplary books like Mitchell&#x2019;s that budding statesmen can learn how to assess our own strategic environment with an eye to long-term security and prosperity."<b>--Paul A. Rahe, author of <i>The Grand Strategy of Classical Sparta: The Persian Challenge</i></b></p><p>"When I introduced imperial grand strategy as a subject starting with the Romans and later the Byzantines, it was my hope that others would examine the other empires I was most curious about, and this duly happened. It was evident that the Habsburg case would be especially challenging, because the very success of that long-lived empire derived from its exceptional fluidity--good for its survival, but hard to depict systematically. That is the challenge that Mitchell has fully confronted. His book corrects many misconceptions about an empire that still evokes nostalgic musings."<b>--Edward N. Luttwak, author of <i>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire</i></b></p><p>"It has become fashionable to assert that strategy is for amateurs, or that it&#x2019;s impossible, so that the best we can hope for is rapid adaptation in the face of new challenges. In illuminating and delightfully readable prose, A. Wess Mitchell offers a historically grounded corrective to this line of thinking with a pathbreaking analysis of the grand strategy of the Habsburg Empire."<b>--Jacqueline Deal, CEO of the Long Term Strategy Group</b></p><p> "An extremely important and well-researched book. It represents a major contribution to the study of the Habsburg Empire and statecraft more broadly."<b>--Eliot A. Cohen, author of <i>The Big Stick: The Limits of Soft Power and the Necessity of Military Force</i></b></p><p> "Outstanding.

Frances Belmonte-Mann and Jessica H. Gerdes pay particular attention to the increase in students with special needs and chronic conditions that affect education. They go beyond the common health history to help readers evaluate the health of students as it relates to academic achievement. The authors focus on: -turning over every stone in a search for unknown health conditions or unrecognized effects of known health conditions; -understanding the role school nurses play in the special education process and writing individualized education program goals for health issues that affect learning; and -applying instructional techniques and nursing interventions to improve student outcomes in a meaningful way. While written for nurses, the guide serves as an important resource for other school staff members, including principals, assistant principals, deans, department chairs, team leaders, special education coordinators, district administrators, classroom teachers, and others with questions about the role nurses play in special education.</p><p>Frances Belmonte-Mann, MA, BSN, RN, IL PEL/School Nurse, PEL/ADM, NCSN has been a School Administrator/School Nurse for over 25 years, which she continues to do part-time.

As the title indicates, REBT promotes an attitude of tolerance, an open-minded willingness to accept the frailties, less-than-ideal behaviors, and unique characteristics of both others and ourselves. Ellis persuasively demonstrates that lack of tolerance of our own imperfections can easily lead to emotional disturbances and unhappiness. And intolerance of others, which fails to account for the great diversity of human personalities and behaviors, can become a serious disruptive force in today's highly diverse, multicultural global society.To counter such negative tendencies, Ellis advocates the adoption and practice of three basic attitudes of tolerance: (1) Unconditional Self-Acceptance (USA); (2) Unconditional Other-Acceptance (UOA); and (3) Unconditional Life-Acceptance (ULA). He discusses the philosophical foundations of these principles and then devotes a number of chapters to comparing REBT to spiritual and religious philosophies. He points out the dangers of fanatical tendencies in religion while also showing how the basic principles of REBT are similar to some ancient religious philosophies such as Zen Buddhism and the Judeo-Christian Golden Rule. In addition, he criticizes certain secular philosophies for their extremism, including Fascism and Ayn Rand's Objectivism, and he also discusses the ramifications of applying REBT in the social, political, and economic sphere.In emphasizing how easy it is for all of us to think, feel, and act intolerantly, Ellis brilliantly shows that tolerance is a deliberate, rational choice that we can all make, both for the good of ourselves and for the good of the world.</p><p><b>Albert Ellis, PhD</b>&nbsp;(1913-2007) practiced psychotherapy, marriage and family counseling, and sex therapy for over sixty years. He was the author of more than eighty books, including many popular best sellers. Other books by Albert Ellis available from Prometheus Books are:&nbsp;<i>The Myth of Self-Esteem; The Road to Tolerance; Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me&#x2014;It Can Work for You; Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors: New Directions for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy</i>; and (with Raymond J. Yeager)&nbsp;<i>Why Some Therapies Don&#x2019;t Work: The Dangers of Transpersonal Psychology</i>.Now over 90 years old, the ebullient cognitive therapy pioneer Ellis has written more than 75 books, most of which advocate his brand of psychotherapy, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. Writing in the no-nonsense style that characterizes his public speaking, Ellis opens his latest with an overview of how his therapeutic principles evolved. Dismissing Freudian therapy as ineffectual and opposing Jung's mysticism, Ellis believes in helping clients banish self-defeating thoughts, or "negative nonsense," in order to take control of their lives. Ellis, who claims to have discovered his main idea&#x2014;that people largely upset themselves with these negative thoughts&#x2014;in classical and Asian philosophy, recommends his teachings as a general guide to life. Assuming religious belief to be the most prevalent popular philosophy, he discusses&#x2014;with the cautiousness of a self-declared atheist&#x2014;some of the benefits of religious belief but warns against fundamentalism. He also pours doubt on religion's capacity for improving thought processes. And he takes on&#x2014;not for the first time&#x2014; Ayn Rand's Objectivism, using some entertainingly gossipy anecdotes culled from personal encounters with her. Throughout, Ellis demonstrates how it might be possible to salvage religion's humanistic and caring aspects for the purposes of therapy. Ellis's fans will enjoy his characteristically forthright engagement with definitions of spirituality and his honest, lively reappraisal of his own thought. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Garnering the highest praise of critics, Jacobsen won many of Norway's and Sweden's most prestigious literary awards, including the Swedish Academy's Dobloug Prize and the Grand Nordic Prize, also known as the "Little Nobel." But he also has earned a wide popular audience, because ordinary readers can understand and enjoy the way he explores the complex counterpoint of nature and technology, progress and self-destruction, daily life and cosmic wonder.<br> <br> Drawing from all twelve of his books, and including one poem collected posthumously, <i>North in the World</i> offers award-winning English translations of Jacobsen's poems, accompanied by the original Norwegian texts. The translator, the American poet Roger Greenwald, worked with Jacobsen himself to correct errors that had crept into the Norwegian texts over the years. An in-depth introduction by Greenwald highlights the main features of Jacobsen's poetry, and extensive endnotes, as well as indexes to titles and first lines in both languages, enhance the usefulness of the book for general readers and scholars alike. The result is the definitive bilingual edition of Jacobsen's marvelous poetry.<br></p></p><p><b>Roger Greenwald</b> is the author of two books of poems, <i>Connecting Flight</i> and <i>Slow Mountain Train,</i> and the translator of several works from Scandinavian languages, including <i>Guarding the Air: Selected Poems of Gunnar Harding</i>.

Americans more often rely on legal threats and lawsuits. American laws are generally more complicated and prescriptive, adjudication more costly, and penalties more severe. In a thoughtful and cogently argued book, Robert Kagan examines the origins and consequences of this system of "adversarial legalism."</p><p>Kagan describes the roots of adversarial legalism and the deep connections it has with American political institutions and values. He investigates its social costs as well as the extent to which lawyers perpetuate it. Ranging widely across many legal fields, including criminal law, environmental regulations, tort law, and social insurance programs, he provides comparisons with the legal and regulatory systems of western Europe, Canada, and Japan that point to possible alternatives to the American methods.</p><p>Kagan notes that while adversarial legalism has many virtues, its costs and unpredictability often alienate citizens from the law and frustrate the quest for justice. This insightful study deepens our understanding of law and its relationship to politics in America and raises valuable questions about the future of the American legal system.</p></p><p>Robert A. Kagan is Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley.This is a wonderful piece of work, richly detailed and beautifully written. It is the best, sanest, and most comprehensive evaluation and critique of the American way of law that I have seen. Every serious scholar concerned with justice and efficiency, and every policymaker who is serious about improving the American legal order should read this trenchant and exciting book. (Lawrence Friedman, Stanford University)<br><br>Kagan offers an important and insightful study of American legal culture. Its chief thesis is that the American way of law is best described as "adversarial legalism," or the process by which policy making, implementation, and dispute resolution are dominated by lawyers and litigation. Although the thesis in this form is hardly original, Kagan's treatment of it, ranging across a wide variety of scholarly disciplines, is both comprehensive and critical. A significant advantage of Kagan's treatment is his commitment to a genuinely comparative analysis of American legalism, though one might argue that his assessment of American legal exceptionalism is overstated. Whatever the merits of Kagan's assessment, however, it is made possible by his careful attention to comparative materials and thus shows the promise of an authentic comparative legal methodology. In sum, this is an important, indeed an elegant, book. Highly recommended. (J. E. Finn <i>Choice</i> 2002-03-01)<br><br>[This] book is a <i>tour de force</i>. It is an elegantly written, consistently insightful analysis and critique of the American emphasis on litigation and punitive sanctions in the policy and administrative process...<i>Adversarial Legalism</i> is in many ways a breath of fresh air. Political elites, scholars, and college students alike may find much that is new and surprising in this book--and it is Kagan's key purpose to surprise and stimulate fresh thinking about the range of possibilities for addressing policy problems. His argument is equally critical of the Republican party's sympathy for underdog plaintiffs, and he is virtually unique among prominent legal voices in calling for more government, more bureaucratic discretion, and, at the same time, less opportunity for legal challenge to government and corporate policy. Kagan is also appropriately realistic in recognizing that his critique and reform proposals are greatly out of step with reigning cultural patterns of populist distrust of governmental and corporate power and faith in self-help legal activism, and thus that his proposals are unlikely to succeed in the near future.

This groundbreaking book provides clinicians with a hands-on guide to working with many different kinds of relationship triangles in therapy with families, couples, and individuals. The authors show why triangles come into being, how to predict their evolving nature, and how they can be dealt with and resolved in treatment. A wealth of clinical case material and treatment suggestions illustrates how thinking in terms of threes, as well as individuals and dyads, can greatly increase therapeutic flexibility and effectiveness.

While clinicians almost always recognize notorious triangles for the curses that they are - extramarital affairs, for example, or feuds with the in-laws - many therapists continue to underestimate the extent to which different sorts of triangles complicate most people&#39;s lives. As ubiquitous as they can be destructive, relationship triangles are the focus of this illuminating new work, which provides a groundbreaking analysis of how triangles function and a hands-on guide to working with triangles in therapy with couples, families, and individuals. The authors show how and why triangles come into being, how to predict their evolving nature, and ways therapists can move from individual to dyad to triangle and back again to create a seamless web of therapy that greatly increases therapeutic flexibility and effectiveness.<p></p>Philip J.

A painter of considerable renown himself, he devoted years to traveling throughout England and Europe, where he searched through museums, monasteries, universities, and libraries, gradually amassing a collection of rare manuscripts from which he was able to reconstruct the technical secrets of the great painters of the past. <br>In this comprehensive treasury (two volumes bound as one), Eastlake presents the results of his researches. He offers detailed discussions of Greek and Roman art methods, medieval techniques, tempera painting, the revolutionary use of oil paints by Hubert van Eyck, Flemish methods of preparing colors, and the methods of Reynolds and other 18th-century British masters. The second volume focuses on the technical secrets of members of various Italian schools, including such masters as Leonardo, Raphael, Perugino, Correggio, Andrea del Sarto, and many others. Rounding off the book are more than 100 pages of professional essays covering a wide range of subjects &#x2014; from "Life in Inanimate Things" and "Neutral Tints in White and Other Draperies" to "Venetian Process" and "How to Compose and Paint a Single Head."

Preliminary chapters present the principles necessary for a patient-oriented, personalized, hypothesis-testing approach to neuropsychological assessment. The subsequent chapters contain nearly all of the tests and assessment techniques covered in the previous editions plus many additional ones, including newly developed neuropsychological tests, tests from other branches of psychology, research techniques that have only recently been introduced into clinical neuropsychology, tests originating in Europe and elsewhere, and a few measures as yet untried by neuropsychologists. In a reorganization designed to meet current thinking and assessment procedures, tests originally offered in prepackaged batteries are now presented within their appropriate functional domains. For example, individual memory tests -- whether developed singly or for use in a commercial battery -- are discussed in the chapter on memory tests, while a new chapter deals with memory batteries, questionnaires, and inventories. A separate chapter reviews prepackaged and commercial test batteries used for general-purpose neuropsychological assessment, but the individual tests from these batteries are treated elsewhere according to the salient functions they examine. Following chapters on observational measurement techniques and on measures of personality and emotional status, the concluding chapter presents an array of techniques that have been used to identify motivational problems and malingering.</p><p><br>Muriel Deutsch Lezak, Ph.D., is Professor of Neurology, Psychiatry and Neurosurgery at Oregon Health Sciences University.<br>"In every field of scientific study, a few books achieve the regal status of helping to define that field.

Simpson</i> is one of those as-told-to books, the tellers being Detective Tom Lange and Detective Philip Vannatter, who led the investigation into the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. Here, free from the constraints of courtroom procedure, cross-examination, and public relations spin, they present their side of the story, including much evidence that never saw its day in court. <p> Detectives Lange and Vannatter took a lot of flak during the first Simpson trial and in the barrage of books that followed. In <i>Evidence Dismissed</i> they have their revenge by pointing out errors in the prosecution's case and getting in a few digs at the defense attorneys. As told to Dan E. Moldea, a veteran crime reporter, this latest insider story sheds some new light on the behind-the-scenes activity surrounding the most recent "Trial of the Century."</p>"You were honest with me right from the beginning, just saying you're doing your job. I know you do a good job." - O.J. Simpson to Tom Lange, via cellular phone during the Bronco chase <p> In this astonishing book, veteran LAPD detectives Tom Lange and Philip Vannatter -- the leaders of the investigation into the Brown/Goldman double murder -- fully chronicle the police case that brought O.J. Simpson to trial. Here for the first time are the plain facts of the sensational case, recounted in the kind of riveting detail only the detectives on the scene could deliver. And this is also the disturbing story of how solid, professional police work became <i>Evidence Dismissed.</i> </p><p> Drawing from personal journals, police logs, and audiotapes, Lange and Vannatter reconstruct the entire five-day investigation, beginning with the 3 am calls on June 13, 1994, that summoned them to the crime scene. Scarcely four hours later, in the early dawn light, they made a shocking discovery that would soon reverberate around the world: a trail of blood leading literally to Simpson's front door. Now, this insider account brings all aspects of the case into compelling focus, revealing: <br>What precisely was discovered at Simpson's Rockingham estate, why it was declared a crime scene, and what role Mark Fuhrman really played in the investigation <br>Their struggle to protect the Bundy crime scene, keep the media at bay, and ensure that the coroner -- who outranked them -- was as thorough as possible <br>A transcript of their bizarre interview with Simpson the day after the murders <br>How Marcia Clark became the D.A. assigned to the case, and the tension it created <br>A transcript of Lange's pleading call to Simpson's cellular phone during the infamous Bronco chase <br>The behind-the-scenes maneuvering at both the criminal and civil trials, including how crucial evidence came to be excluded.

Simpson case boiled down to a controversial verdict. For detectives Lange and Vannatter, it was always about solving a double murder. <i>Evidence Dismissed</i> is a powerful reminder that the killer in this case still roams free.</p></p><h2>Psychotherapy and Process: The Fundamentals of an Existential-Humanistic Approach (Addison-Wesley Series in Computer Science)</h2><p>Psychotherapy and Process: The Fundamentals of an Existential-humanistic Approach (Addison-Wesley series in clinical and professional psychology)</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Sonnets and Poems (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This is the only fully annotated and modernized edition to bring together Shakespeare&#39;s sonnets as well as all his poems (including those attributed to him after his death) in one volume.

Author Joann Keyton points to the five key elements that define a group--size, interdependence, identity, goal, and structure--and demonstrates how group processes are facilitated or hindered by them. Using examples from field research on both task and social groups, Keyton depicts group interaction as it emerges through conversation. She provides frameworks for analyzing group interaction, recommendations for effective group practice, and numerous transcripts of authentic group communication that help to underscore the concepts. <br> Thoroughly revised in this third edition, the book features new material on communication structures, group tasks and activities, communication competence, and decision making. Keyton includes updated literature reflecting recent communication and interdisciplinary group theory and research, and she also places more emphasis on gender and cultural diversity, stressing the need for students to consider the multiple ways in which diversity influences group interaction. Highlighting the important connection between task and relational messages in both task and social groups, <em>Communicating in</em> <em>Groups</em>, Third Edition, is ideal for undergraduate courses in group and team communication, as well as for management and business communication courses in group behavior and teamwork.<br></p><p>Joann Keyton is at University of Kansas.</p><h2>Wisdom Won from Illness: Essays in Philosophy and Psychoanalysis</h2><p><p><i>Wisdom Won from Illness </i>brings into conversation two fields of humane inquiry&#x2015;psychoanalysis and moral philosophy&#x2015;that seem to have little to say to each other but which, taken together, form a basis for engaged ethical thought about how to live.</p><p>Jonathan Lear begins by looking to the ancient Greek philosophers for insight into what constitutes the life well lived. Socrates said the human psyche should be ruled by reason, and much philosophy as well as psychology hangs on what he meant. For Aristotle, reason organized and presided over the harmonious soul; a wise person is someone capable of a full, happy, and healthy existence. Freud, plumbing the depths of unconscious desires and pre-linguistic thoughts, revealed just how unharmonious the psyche could be. Attuned to the stresses of modern existence, he investigated the myriad ways people fall ill and fail to thrive. Yet he inherited from Plato and Aristotle a key insight: that the irrational part of the soul is not simply opposed to reason. It is a different manner of thinking: a creative intelligence that distorts what it seeks to understand.</p><p>Can reason absorb the psyche&#x2019;s nonrational elements into a whole conception of the flourishing, fully realized human being? Without a good answer to that question, Lear says, philosophy is cut from its moorings in human life. <i>Wisdom Won from Illness</i> illuminates the role of literature in shaping ethical thought about nonrational aspects of the mind, offering rich readings of Shakespeare, Kierkegaard, J. M. Coetzee, Marilynne Robinson, and others.</p></p><p>Jonathan Lear is John U. Nef Distinguished Service Professor in the Committee on Social Thought and the Department of Philosophy at the University of Chicago. He is also the Roman Family Director of the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society.&#x201c;Lear takes a subtly radical position in <i>Wisdom Won from Illness</i>, arguing that psychoanalysis is not merely a venture one undertakes in the hope of relieving suffering (of achieving a level of contentment, of escaping symptoms of depression and anxiety), but in the hope of living <i>well</i>. This is one of the poignant qualities of this collection of essays: it asks more of humans than that they be content; it asks that humans not only live happily, but excellently. And it doesn&#x2019;t merely hope for humans to do this, it expects it of them, and shows in clinical vignettes drawn from Lear&#x2019;s private practice that the human need for truth&#x2015;to understand ourselves and the world in which we live, and to be able to consciously marshal our unconscious life for our own development&#x2015;is overwhelmingly powerful. Lear, like all great teachers, has the remarkable ability to remind us of this truth, even when this truth has gone out of fashion. Such a grand expectation for human life belongs, traditionally, to philosophy, not to psychoanalysis, but in Lear&#x2019;s hands psychoanalysis is unique in that it can do the healing work of medicine and the enlightening work of philosophy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Benjamin H.

The importance of the issues they present is never merely antiquarian. Lear is committed to the vital relevance of these works to our own understanding of what is important about the life of an embodied human soul.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Doyle, Harvard University</b></p><h2>The Third Reich: Politics and Propaganda</h2><p>In <i>The Third Reich</i>, David Welch presents a controversial account of the notorious Nazi policy and propaganda machine. Welch argues that Nazi propaganda primarily affected those who already believed in the Nazi tenets of racial purity, and that the propagandists, in fact, were largely unsuccessful in the achievement of their aims.<br> <br> Welch assesses both the theory and the practice of Nazi propaganda, as well as the reactions of the German public to the major themes and campaigns which the State conducted in peacetime and at war. He further questions whether dissent existed behind the facade of national unity, and if this dissent was rendered so ineffective by terror alone. <i>The Third Reich</i> includes also a document section which evaluates the speeches of Adolf Hitler and Josef Goebbels, and the laws that shaped the mass-media in the Third Reich. By examining Nazi propaganda in light of wider interpretive questions about the Third Reich, Welch challenges popular assumptions about Nazi propaganda, and argues that in many ways Goebbels' propaganda machine was a failure.<br> <br> <i>The Third Reich</i> explores the popularity of National Socialism by examining the roles of consent and coercion in sustaining the regime. While these are not new issues, they have burning importance in light of current Neo-Nazi activity and economic frustration in reunified Germany--for to understand the nature of Nazism is to be forearmed against its recurrence.</p><p>David Welch is Professor of Modern European History at the University of Kent at Canterbury.". . .a useful and compact introduction to an important aspect of the Nazi regime for students and interested laymen alike." -- <i><i>The Historian</i></i></p><h2>Great Plains</h2><p>Photographs, some never before published, taken by a renowned photographer of Native Americans showcase the indelible images of the Piegan, Sioux, Apsaroke, Cheyenne, Blackfoot, Ogalala, and other Plains peoples.</p><p></p><h2>Utilitarianism and Beyond</h2><p>A volume of studies of utilitarianism considered both as a theory of personal morality and a theory of public choice.

Set in the 1930s, this book traces the rise and fall of Willie Stark, who resembles the real-life Huey &#34;Kingfish&#34; Long of Louisiana. Stark begins his political career as an idealistic man of the people but soon becomes corrupted by success.</p><p>This landmark book is a loosely fictionalized account of Governor Huey Long of Louisiana, one of the nation's most astounding politicians. <b>All the King's Men</b> tells the story of Willie Stark, a southern-fried politician who builds support by appealing to the common man and playing dirty politics with the best of the back-room deal-makers. Though Stark quickly sheds his idealism, his right-hand man, Jack Burden -- who narrates the story -- retains it and proves to be a thorn in the new governor's side. Stark becomes a successful leader, but at a very high price, one that eventually costs him his life.

It is also more open to balanced examination now--at the end of its long war in the north of Ireland--than it was even a few years ago. <br> Richard English's brilliant book offers a detailed history of the IRA, providing invaluable historical depth to our understanding of the modern-day Provisionals, the more militant wing formed in 1969 dedicated to the removal of the British Government from Northern Ireland and the reunification of Ireland. English examines the dramatic events of the Easter Rising in 1916 and the bitter guerrilla war of 1919-21; the partitioning of Ireland in the 1920s and the Irish Civil War of 1922-23. Here, too are the IRA campaigns in Northern Ireland and Britain during the 1930s, 1940, 1950s and 1960s. He shows how the Provisionals were born out of the turbulence generated by the 1960s civil rights movement; examines the escalating violence; the introduction of British troops to the streets of Northern Ireland; the split in the IRA which produced the Provisionals; the introduction of internment in 1971 and the tragedy of Bloody Sunday in 1972. He then examines the struggle over political status, culminating in the Hunger Strikes of the early 1980s and moves on to describe the Provisionals' emergence as a more committed political force throughout that decade, a politicization that made possible the peace process that has developed over the last decade. <br> English offers a dazzling synthesis of the motives, actions and consequences of the IRA. Neither romanticizing the IRA nor condemning them out of hand, this is a balanced, definitive treatment of one of the world's leading revolutionary movements.</p><p><br><strong>Richard English</strong> is Professor of Politics at Queen's University, Belfast. His previous books include <em>Ernie O'Malley: IRA Intellectual</em> and <em>Radicals and the Republic: Socialist Republicanism in the Irish Free State 1925-1937</em>.<br><br>"This an essential book. At a stroke it replaces the many journalistic 'histories' of the IRA, too often flaccid and shoddy."--Roy Foster, <em>The Times</em> (London)<p></p><br>"A fluent, fascinating account of the origins, actions and ideologies of that caucus of shadows, the Provisional IRA."--<em>Observer</em><p></p><br>"This vivid, reflective work will likely become the standard introduction to the subject. It also serves as a valuable corrective for anyone who thinks that the difficulties in Northern Ireland are amenable to quick-fix solutions."--<em>Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"With fine detail and a flair for narrative, Richard English chronicles the rise of the IRA from the ashes of the Easter rising to the promise of peace today. Balanced and thoughtful, <em>Armed Struggle</em> offers new insight into Ireland's republican movement. And it reminds us, in the author's words, that 'the voices of the victims still deafen.'"--Terry Golway, author of <em>The Irish in America</em><p></p><br>"About Richard English's <em>Armed Struggle: History of the IRA</em> there is a kind of passionate objectivity you'll rarely find on this subject. The author works mightily to present two sides of a story that keeps shifting. You might read the book wondering, perhaps, where his sympathies lie, but even if you sneak a look at the last chapter, where he lays out his credentials, you'll come away impressed with his balance and fairness. I am neither scholar nor historian, but this is the one book I recommend for anyone trying to understand the craziness and complexity of the Northern Ireland tragedy."--Frank McCourt, author of <em>Angela's Ashes</em><p></p><br>"What impressed me most was the way Richard English managed to present such an historical and contradictory mess with such clarity and fairness. The book grabbed and held me like a very good novel."--Roddy Doyle, author of <em>A Star Called Henry</em><p></p><br>"Here is the book we have been waiting for--the first full history of the I.R.A. and the best account by far of the twentieth century's longest war. Richard English has read everything--from secret documents to the Long Kesh library --and he has talked to the men who fought the war. He also brings a rare balance of empathy and judgement to a topic that desperately needs both. The result is a superb piece of writing: clear, insightful, and engrossing. If you want to know where the I.R.A. came from and how they think, this is the book to read."--Peter Hart, Chair of Irish Studies, Memorial University and the author of <em>The IRA and It's Enemies</em><p></p><br>"English's balanced and complex account of the IRA, more particularly the Provisional IRA, will help anyone understand the strong feelings and difficult issues behind today's headlines.... The author, a professor of politics at Queen's University in Belfast, makes some controversial assertions, as when he claims that the IRA's post-1969 violence, ostensibly aimed at protecting Catholics, only lead to increased anti-Catholic carnage. Even more controversially, English calls into question the whole point of the long IRA war. What English does brilliantly is to describe the IRA's own justifications for its war against Britain, with special attention to the socialism pervading much of IRA belief. He has written a provocative and essential book for anyone trying to understand Northern Ireland's tempestuous recent history."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The American Story, Vol. 1: To 1877, 3rd Edition (Penguin Academics Series)</h2><p><p><i><b><i>The American Story </i></b></i><b>presents a balanced and manageable overview of the United States as an unfolding story of national development, integrating social and political history into a coherent and compelling narrative. </b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Acknowledging the nation's rich diversity of class, race, gender, and ethnicity, this edition tells the story both of the people who, through their collective and individual endeavors, shaped the past and of the demands that events placed upon them.

Published in conjunction with a retrospective exhibition of the American painter&#x2019;s fifty-year career, <i>Of Dogs and Other People</i> reassesses De Forest&#x2019;s art-historical position, placing him in a national rather than solely West Coast context.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite the playfulness of his work, close study of De Forest&#x2019;s art reveals deep layers of meaning. He was a fan of adventure stories, pulp fiction, and underground commix, but he also commanded a vast knowledge of art history and read widely in a variety of disciplines, including poetry, literature, philosophy, psychology, science, and mathematics. He enjoyed secreting obscure art-historical references into his work: animals assume postures found in Medieval or Renaissance art, and his compositional strategies draw from sources ranging from the romantic landscape painters of the Hudson River School to the austere geometric abstractions of Piet Mondrian.<br> This engaging publication presents gorgeous color reproductions of De Forest&#x2019;s finest artworks, plus a variety of figure illustrations that illuminate the artist&#x2019;s diverse sources and freewheeling social and creative milieu in Northern California.<br> &nbsp;<br> Published in association with the Oakland Museum of California.<br><br> Exhibition dates:<br> Oakland Museum of California: April 29&#x2013;August 20, 2017</p><p><b>Susan Landauer</b>&nbsp;holds a Ph.D. from Yale University and is an independent curator and writer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

As it turns out, software quality problems are a major contributing factor to computer security problems. Increasingly, companies large and small depend on software to run their businesses every day. The current approach to software quality and security taken by software companies, system integrators, and internal development organizations is like driving a car on a rainy day with worn-out tires and no air bags. In both cases, the odds are that something bad is going to happen, and there is no protection for the occupant/owner. This book will help the reader understand how to make software quality part of the design&#x2014;a key change from where we are today!&#x201d; </p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2014;<b>Tony Scott</b> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Technology Officer, IS&amp;S<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Motors Corporation<br> <p> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about time someone wrote a book to teach the good guys what the bad guys already know.

How do attackers make software break on purpose? Why are firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software not keeping out the bad guys? What tools can be used to break software? This book provides the answers.</p> <p> <b> <i>Exploiting Software</i> </b> is loaded with examples of real attacks, attack patterns, tools, and techniques used by bad guys to break software. If you want to protect your software from attack, you must first learn how real attacks are really carried out. </p> <p>This must-have book may shock you--and it will certainly educate you.Getting beyond the script kiddie treatment found in many hacking books, you will learn about</p> <ul> <li>Why software exploit will continue to be a serious problem</li> <li>When network security mechanisms do not work</li> <li>Attack patterns</li> <li>Reverse engineering</li> <li>Classic attacks against server software</li> <li>Surprising attacks against client software</li> <li>Techniques for crafting malicious input</li> <li>The technical details of buffer overflows</li> <li>Rootkits</li> </ul> <p> <b> <i>Exploiting Software</i> </b> is filled with the tools, concepts, and knowledge necessary to break software.</p> <br> <br> <p></p></p><p>Computing hardware would have no value without software; software tells hardware what to do. Software therefore must have special authority within computing systems. All computer security problems stem from that fact, and <i>Exploiting Software: How to Break Code</i> shows you how to design your software so it's as resistant as possible to attack. Sure, everything's phrased in offensive terms (as instructions for the attacker, that is), but this book has at least as much value in showing designers what sorts of attacks their software will face (the book could serve as a checklist for part of a pre-release testing regimen). Plus, the clever reverse-engineering strategies that Greg Hoglund and Gary McGraw teach will be useful in many legitimate software projects. Consider this a recipe book for mayhem, or a compendium of lessons learned by others. It depends on your situation.<p> PHP programmers will take issue with the authors' blanket assessment of their language ("PHP is a study in bad security"), much of which seems based on older versions of the language that had some risky default behaviors--but those programmers will also double-check their servers' register_globals settings. Users of insufficiently patched Microsoft and Oracle products will worry about the detailed attack instructions this book contains. Responsible programmers and administrators will appreciate what amounts to documentation of attackers' rootkits for various operating systems, and will raise their eyebrows at the techniques for writing malicious code to unused EEPROM chips in target systems. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: How to make software fail, either by doing something it wasn't designed to do, or by denying its use to its rightful users. Techniques--including reverse engineering, buffer overflow, and particularly provision of unexpected input--are covered along with the tools needed to carry them out.

He is CEO of HBGary, Inc., a leading provider of software security verification services.

Susan Levine investigates the politics and culture of food; most specifically, who decides what American children should be eating, what policies develop from those decisions, and how these policies might be better implemented.</p><br><p> Even now, the school lunch program remains problematic, a juggling act between modern beliefs about food, nutrition science, and public welfare. Levine points to the program menus' dependence on agricultural surplus commodities more than on children's nutritional needs, and she discusses the political policy barriers that have limited the number of children receiving meals and which children were served. But she also shows why the school lunch program has outlasted almost every other twentieth-century federal welfare initiative. In the midst of privatization, federal budget cuts, and suspect nutritional guidelines where even ketchup might be categorized as a vegetable, the program remains popular and feeds children who would otherwise go hungry.</p><br><p> As politicians and the media talk about a national obesity epidemic, <i>School Lunch Politics</i> is a timely arrival to the food policy debates shaping American health, welfare, and equality.</p></p><p><p>"With <i>School Lunch Politics</i>, Sue Levine has served up a rich plate on which the histories of food, public policy, childhood, and social reform come together in complicated, intermingling ways. The result is a capacious and balanced book about the elusive quest for an equitable society and a balanced meal."<b>--Daniel Horowitz, author of <i>The Anxieties of Affluence</i></b></p><p>"<i>School Lunch Politics</i> tells the fascinating history of the National School Lunch Program, which officially began in 1946 and continues to this day. This is an important book and will be valuable for many audiences. It should receive attention not only from historians (especially historians of twentieth-century social policy) but also a broader audience interested in the current obesity crisis and the commercialization of public life.

In so doing, <i>Salvation Army</i> manages to burn through the author's first-person singularity to embody the complex m�lange of fear and desire projected by Arabs on Western culture. Recently hailed by his native country's press as &#x201c;the first Moroccan to have the courage to publicly assert his difference,&#x201d; Ta�a, through his calmly transgressive work, has &#x201c;outed&#x201d; himself as &#x201c;the only gay man&#x201d; in a country whose theocratic law still declares homosexuality a crime. The persistence of prejudices on all sides of the Mediterranean and Atlantic makes the translation of Ta�a's work both a literary and political event. The arrival of <i>Salvation Army</i> (published in French in 2006) in English will be welcomed by an American audience already familiar with a growing cadre of talented Arab writers working in French (including Muhammad Dib, Assia Djebar, Tahar Ben Jelloun, Abdelkebir Khatibi, and Katib Yasin). </p></p><p>Abdellah Ta�a (born in 1973) is the author of six novels, including <i>Salvation Army</i> and <i>An Arab Melancholia</i>, both published by Semiotext(e), and <i>Infidels</i>. His novel <i>Le jour du roi</i>, about the death of Morocco's King Hassan II, won the 2010 Prix de Flore. He also directed and wrote the screenplay for the 2013 film adaptation of <i>Salvation Army</i>.Ta�a's slim and disjointed autobiographical coming-of-age story begins in poverty in Sal�, Morocco, where young Abdellah reports on the impoverished town's doings. As a young adult, he falls for an older man who introduces him to Europe and the possibility of leaving home and its repressive social mores behind. But the story feels haphazard, and the narrative hinges on a string of taboo-breaking accounts of Ta�a's amorous encounters, from his incestuous desire for his older brother to his troubled first love, then a threesome, then a random encounter in a public toilet. For all its frank sexuality and candor, the novel feels canned and unconvincing. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Museum is famed for its Greek vases. Joan R. Mertens, Curator in the Department of Greek and Roman Art at the Metropolitan, has chosen thirty-five notable examples. They reveal the variety and vitality of the refined forms and masterfully rendered scenes that characterize these works. And they demonstrate the interrelation of function, shape, technique, and subject matter that is key to understanding the rich language of Greek vases. The introduction provides valuable background information, and the entries delve into the features of each vase, incorporating brilliant color illustrations, including many arresting details.&nbsp; </p><p>Greek vases served specific utilitarian functions, and they also afforded outstanding artists, some of whom signed their work, a medium for depicting both the details of daily existence and aspects of their gods, goddesses, and heroes. We see the garments, implements, athletic competitions, and marriage and funerary rituals of Greeks who lived from the seventh through the fourth century B.C. We see their mythological figures and stories, for instance, the goddess Athena with her helmet, spear, and shield, and the great hero Herakles, from his first exploit as a baby to his elevation as an immortal at the end of his earthly life.&nbsp; </p><p>The exceptional group of works assembled in this volume conveys the extent to which the culture of ancient Greece is still apparent today. Urns and jars inspired by Greek models are a staple in all types of public and private spaces. The meander patterns, palmettes, and other florals that adorn ancient vases recur in all kinds of modern objects. And the concept of the hero, or superman, first formulated and given visual form in ancient Greece is integral to Western culture.&nbsp; </p><p><i>How to Read Greek Vases</i> is sure to inspire closer scrutiny of these remarkable works of art, which have survived for over two millennia to offer viewers an enlightening look into the ancient heritage of the Western world.</p></p><p><b>Joan R. Mertens</b> is Curator in the Department of Greek and Roman Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&#x201c;It is refreshing to encounter a catalogue of museum vases that is not entirely masterpieces, but rather an erudite selection that informs the reader about the vast range and ingenuity of Greek ceramics.

He shows how these changes affect everyday life how the work ethic is changing; how new beliefs about merit and talent displace old values of craftsmanship and achievement; how what Sennett calls the specter of uselessness&#x201d; haunts professionals as well as manual workers; how the boundary between consumption and politics is dissolving.<p></p>In recent years, reformers of both private and public institutions have preached that flexible, global corporations provide a model of freedom for individuals, unlike the experience of fixed and static bureaucracies Max Weber once called an iron cage.&#x201d; Sennett argues that, in banishing old ills, the new-economy model has created new social and emotional traumas. Only a certain kind of human being can prosper in unstable, fragmentary institutions: the culture of the new capitalism demands an ideal self oriented to the short term, focused on potential ability rather than accomplishment, willing to discount or abandon past experience. In a concluding section, Sennett examines a more durable form of self hood, and what practical initiatives could counter the pernicious effects of reform.&#x201d;<p></p></p><p><b>Richard Sennett</b> teaches sociology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the London School of Economics.

Solow)</p><h2>Archaeology: Original Readings in Method and Practice</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Written by some of the top archaeologists in the country, this collection of 25 articles covers the entire range of archaeological methods as well as issues and controversies in contemporary archaeology. <b> </b> Illustrates through case studies how archaeologists put methods into practice to solve problems. Explores how ideas were formed and research conducted along with the people behind the process of archaeological discovery. Focuses on how archaeologists find and recover data from archaeological sites and materials, with examples from the contributors' own research. Examines issues and controversies in contemporary archaeology, discussing different theories, opinions, and evidence on various issues. <b> </b> For anyone interested in learning more about archaeological methods and discoveries. </p></p><p><p> Which would you rather read: (A) "The stratigraphic profile was partially obscured due to the extremely arid conditions," or (B) "The dust rising from the strong desert wind made it hard for me to see the stratigraphy"? If you answered B, then this book is for you. Most collections of articles that are used in undergraduate courses are made up of works patched together from material written by archaeologists for other archaeologists or, in some cases, for a popular audience. Rarely are works included that were written explicitly for college students. This is a problem, for works written for scholars are too detailed and jargon-laden for students to digest easily, while works written for a popular audience contain little information that would be new to students who have already been exposed to archaeology. This book, on the other hand, is composed of chapters written explicitly for college students. The chapters are not reprints of articles published elsewhere, but were composed for you, a student of archaeology, to help you appreciate the methods, practices, and experiences of some of the top archaeologists working today. </p> <p> How do the chapters in this book differ from those in other collections? Usually when we read an article or book chapter about a piece of research, we find out about the results&#x2014;what the researchers think they have discovered, what they think they know. Rarely do we get to understand the process. Where do ideas come from? How does an idea get transformed into a research project? What was exciting about the research? What was disappointing? What is the person behind the process like? These questions are rarely addressed in scholarly writing, and they are often absent even in popular accounts of research. Here these questions are central, for the archaeologists who wrote the chapters in this collection wanted to help you understand the process of archaeological discovery. They wanted you to understand not only what they found, but also how they went about finding it, and what the experience was like. Most of all, they wanted to excite you about archaeology&#x2014;not only about the findings in archaeology, but also about the process of doing archaeology itself. </p> <p> The purpose of this collection is to make research more alive for students like you who are just beginning to get to know archaeology. Part I, "Archaeological Methods," focuses on the way archaeologists find and recover data from archaeological sites and materials. Rather than being dry "by-the-numbers" instructions for doing research, each chapter brings the experiences and insights of an active archaeologist to the practical matters of doing archaeological research. The authors all provide examples from their own research to give you a better sense of how archaeological methods are actually employed in the field and laboratory. </p> <p> Part II, "Issues and Controversies in Contemporary Archaeology," also tries to convey a feeling for the research process, but each chapter is focused on a particular issue or controversy rather than a method. Here the authors deal with some of the following kinds of questions: "What are the different theories or opinions in this controversy?" "What is the evidence, if any, for each side?" "What kinds of research might be brought to bear on this issue to help resolve it?" "What rethinking might be necessary?" By focusing on issues and controversies where there is no obvious agreement in the archaeological community, the authors convey a feeling for the dynamics of research and the excitement of debate. </p> <p> The dynamics of research are further explored in Part III, "Archaeological Case Studies." Here the authors illustrate how they applied archaeological methods to particular cases of interest to them&#x2014;from the origins of complex polities in sub-Saharan Africa to gender roles in the Inka empire. As in Part II, the authors in Part III deal with a set of related questions: "What made you interested in this particular case?" "What data did you need to examine this case?" "What methods did you use to collect the data?" "What did you discover and what new questions did your research raise?" The purpose of Part III is to illustrate the variety of questions asked by archaeologists and the diverse methods they use to answer them. </p> <p> Finally, Part IV, "Archaeologists at Work," includes two autobiographical articles. We left it up to the archaeologists to choose what they wanted to write about. After all, we want you to get a feeling for how archaeological researchers vary, not just how archaeological research varies. In these ways, we hope you will come to appreciate that archaeology is not just an unemotional set of methods and data, but rather a bunch of hard-working, insightful people who employ those methods to answer particular questions about the past. </p></p><h2>Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment</h2><p><p>This book examines some of the deepest questions in philosophy: What is involved in judging a belief, action, or feeling to be rational? What place does morality have in the kind of life it makes most sense to lead? How are we to understand claims to objectivity in moral judgments and in judgments of rationality? When we find ourselves in fundamental disagreement with whole communities, how can we understand our disagreement and cope with it?</p><p>To shed light on such issues, Allan Gibbard develops what he calls a &#x201c;norm-expressivistic analysis&#x201d; of rationality. He refines this analysis by drawing on evolutionary theory and experimental psychology, as well as on more traditional moral and political philosophy. What emerges is an interpretation of human normative life, with its quandaries and disputes over what is rational and irrational, morally right and morally wrong. Judgments of what it makes sense to do, to think, and to feel, Gibbard argues, are central to shaping the way we live our lives.</p><p>Gibbard does not hesitate to take up a wide variety of possible difficulties for his analysis. This sensitivity to the true complexity of the subject matter gives his treatment a special richness and depth. The fundamental importance of the issues he addresses and the freshness and suggestiveness of the account he puts forward, along with his illuminating treatment of aspects of sociobiology theory, will ensure this book a warm reception from philosophers, social scientists, and others with a serious interest in the nature of human thought and action.</p></p><p>Allan Gibbard is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Michigan.&#x201c;A very distinguished book; rich in insights and written with a terse elegance that makes for wonderful clarity and ease of reading.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John McDowell, University of Pittsburgh</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a wonderful book. It is hard to overpraise it. It is learned, wise, deep, and subtle, and for in my view it is substantially right.

Never checked out! Like new condition. Ministry name stamped on first page; cardholder on insider front cover</p><p>Addressed to adults who suffered from child abuse of all kinds, this comprehensive guide by a San Francisco clinical psychologist is a model of clarity and organization. Through case histories of six patients who experienced one or a combination of physical, sexual and emotional abuse in which substance abuse by both abuser and/or victim often played a part, Gannon helps readers recognize which type of abuse they themselves were subjected to, what psychological defenses they developed and what impact abuses had on their lives as lover, spouse, parent, worker. A final section is devoted to a three-stage, flexible 21-step healing process: from child victim to adult survivor, to "self-thriver." Gannon counsels against attempting recovery on one's own in favor of help from a therapist and from a support group. Keeping a journal, he advises, is also essential to record progress, as an outlet for powerful blocked memories and emotions and as a path to self-acceptance and to spiritual renewal. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Essentials of Electrical and Computer Engineering</h2><p><p> <b> </b> With sound, practically-oriented coverage of all the basic concepts in electrical engineering, the second edition of this book represents the best balanced general introduction to the field available.

In <em>Russia: A History</em>, editor Gregory Freeze and twelve other American and European historians have mined these newly opened archives and browsed through the best contemporary scholarship to provide a major reinterpretation of the history of one of the world's great powers.<br> Here is the first major history of Russia to appear since the fall of the Soviet Union, beginning in the 8th century and ranging across a thousand years to the recently established Commonwealth of Independent States. What emerges is a nation of extremes--of imperial opulence and abject poverty, tyrannical power and subversive resistance, artistic achievement and economic crisis, glittering cities and frozen steppes. The contributors capture a powerful sense of Russia's national destiny of repeated themes and unchanging conditions. We see, for instance, that time and again, all-powerful autocrats like Ivan the Terrible and Stalin employed brutality to eliminate any challenge to their authority. Yet their hold on power was always under attack, threatened by bureaucratic incompetence, pervasive corruption, and resistance from below. Russian rulers have also had to contend with the same immense physical challenges: a huge and widely dispersed population, a perennial dearth of means and men to govern, a primitive infrastructure which, as the authors show, periodically dissolved into times of trouble, as in 1598, 1917, and 1991.<br> Handsomely illustrated with nearly 170 illustrations, including 12 color plates, this landmark history cuts through the myths that have surrounded Russia to tell the absorbing story of one of the world's most powerful nations.</p><p>In this heavily illustrated volume, English, American, and German (but, strangely, no Russian) scholars gather to discuss the development of Russia from its medieval founding in the face of Mongol invasions to the election of Boris Yeltsin. The authors are not reluctant to discuss unpleasant truths, such as the officially tolerated famine of the 1930s and the rise of totalitarianism. They also offer controversial theories, such as the view that Lenin, had he lived, would not have supported the cult of personality that surrounded him after his death. The authors take a generally positive view of Russia&#39;s democratic future, noting that the present specter of decline and stagnation ignores the fact that much of Russia&#39;s economy is kept in the shadows, presumably to avoid taxation, and that with more state intervention, not less, the economy will grow as the Russian state rebuilds itself.<br><strong>Gregory L.

She could get the time and the place and the man all together just about all of the time. It did not matter who was in the way. Ellen was judge and executioner. She knew how to escape earth&#39;s usual penalties. Never was there a woman whose appearance so belied her heart. The perfection of her proportions without concealed a fierce unbalance within. Only the posture of her lips and her large eyes betrayed the true woman. This gave to her beauty that suspense that men are impelled to disturb. Against this volatile force Ben Ames Williams has set the strength of a writer&#39;s inward honesty. Here is a struggle between two natures irreconcilably opposed, drawn together by the fatal attraction of equal force.</p><p></p><h2>Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences</h2><p>The subject of mathematical writing has been infused with life once again by Nick Higham as he follows up his successful HWMS volume with this much-anticipated second edition.

To the U.S. and Europe, Ukraine is a country struggling for self-determination in the face of Russia&#x2019;s imperial nostalgia. To Russia, Ukraine is a &#x201c;sister nation,&#x201d; where NATO expansionism threatens its own borders. In Crimea itself, the native Tatars are Muslims who are vehemently opposed to Russian rule.

His novel is at once a major social document and a story that draws us irresistibly into the twilit world of Edwin Reardon, a struggling novelist, and his friends and acquaintances in Grub Street including Jasper Milvain, an ambitious journalist, and Alfred Yule, an embittered critic. Here Gissing brings to life the bitter battles (fought out in obscure garrets or in the Reading Room of the British Museum) between integrity and the dictates of the market place, the miseries of genteel poverty and the damage that failure and hardship do to human personality and relationships.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.Hailed as Gissing's finest novel," New Grub Street portrays the intrigues and hardships of the publishing world in late Victorian England. In a materialistic, class-conscious society that rewards commercial savvy over artistic achievement, authors and scholars struggle to earn a living without compromising their standards. "Even as the novel chills us with its still-recognizable portrayal of the crass and vulgar world of literary endeavor," writes Francine Prose in her Introduction, "its very existence provides eloquent, encouraging proof of the fact that a powerful, honest writer can transcend the constraints of commerce." <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the text of the 1891 first edition.</p><h2>The Seven Hills of Rome: A Geological Tour of the Eternal City</h2><p><p>From humble beginnings, Rome became perhaps the greatest intercontinental power in the world. Why did this historic city become so much more influential than its neighbor, nearby Latium, which was peopled by more or less the same stock? Over the years, historians, political analysts, and sociologists have discussed this question <i>ad infinitum</i>, without considering one underlying factor that led to the rise of Rome--the geology now hidden by the modern city.</p><br><p> This book demonstrates the important link between the history of Rome and its geologic setting in a lively, fact-filled narrative sure to interest geology and history buffs and travelers alike. The authors point out that Rome possessed many geographic advantages over surrounding areas: proximity to a major river with access to the sea, plateaus for protection, nearby sources of building materials, and most significantly, clean drinking water from springs in the Apennines. Even the resiliency of Rome's architecture and the stability of life on its hills are underscored by the city's geologic framework.</p><br><p> If carried along with a good city map, this book will expand the understanding of travelers who explore the eternal city's streets. Chapters are arranged geographically, based on each of the seven hills, the Tiber floodplain, ancient creeks that dissected the plateau, and ridges that rise above the right bank. As an added bonus, the last chapter consists of three field trips around the center of Rome, which can be enjoyed on foot or by using public transportation.</p></p><p><p>"This is the only book I'm aware of that fully integrates the culture and history of a city into its geographical and geological setting. Written by three experts in volcanology and in the geology, culture, and history of Rome, the book has much to offer both the general public and professional city planners. The field trips featured provide guidelines that can be effectively applied to other urban settings, and the book provides good sources for further reading and research."<b>--Ian MacGregor, retired Director, Earth Science Division of the National Science Foundation</b></p><p>"It is most fitting that this book, the first of its kind, should be published on Rome, the most fascinating, ancient--but currently thriving--city in the world. <i>The Seven Hills of Rom</i>e covers more history and geology than any other travel book I have read, and it draws readers in by helping them understand how the benefits of geographical structure play out in everyday life; for example, the authors demonstrate that the golden wines from the Alban Hills are the result of vineyards located on the tuff plateaus or in crater bottoms. Throughout the book, the reader feels part of a very personal journey through the countryside."<b>--Jill Andrews, California Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"The greatest virtue of <i>The Seven Hills of Rome</i> is that it ties the city's human history to its natural history. Now nonspecialists can fully appreciate the extent to which Rome's destiny, its character, even its very appearance, were founded on its unique geological circumstances."<b>--Rabun Taylor, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Part guidebook, part scholarly resource, all fascinating story, The <i>Seven Hills of Rome</i> weaves together the complex geology and history of Rome's unique locale. The book is throughout a revelation--one that not only illuminates the study of the city's past, but nurtures an appreciation of its present and a concern for its future."<b>--Susan E. Alcock, University of Michigan</b></p><p>"This book is not a typical geological guidebook: it tackles a geology that is largely hidden in an area that has been urban for almost three millennia. As such it is great fun--a treasure hunt in which the reader is invited to piece together the evolution of Rome as part of the Adrian microplate as well as of Rome the city. From temples and quarries to floods, earthquakes and eruptions, all is here. Well researched and never dull, this book offers a brand new insight into an ancient city."<b>--Ruth Siddall, University College, London</b></p><p>"The authors use their expertise to explain how the landscape and natural resources of the region around Rome made it an inviting place for human habitation, and served as inspirations for Romans' achievements in civil engineering, architecture, and construction. The walking tours featured in the book constitute an insider's travel guide, and the chapters on the seven hills are highly evocative and will please the armchair traveler."<b>--Gail Mahood, Stanford University</b></p><b>Grant Heiken</b> is a past president of the International Association of Volcanology. He is the author or co-author of several professional and general-interest books on geology, including <i>Volcanoes: Crucibles of Change</i> (Princeton). <b>Renato Funiciello</b> is Professor of Geology at the University of Roma Tre and Vice President of the National Institute for Geophysics. <b>Donatella De Rita</b> is Professor of Field Geology and the Geology of Volcanic Areas at the University of Roma Tre.</p><h2>Totalitarianism: The Inner History of the Cold War</h2><p>For more than six decades, the term "totalitarian" was applied to everything from Franco's Spain to Stalin's Soviet Union. One of the most enigmatic and yet compelling ideas of our time, it has been both an almost meaningless political catcall and an indispensable concept for understanding the dictatorships that have marred the history of this century. Now historian Abbott Gleason provides a fascinating account of the life of this idea.<br> <em>Totalitarianism</em> offers a penetrating chronicle of the central concept of our era--an era shaped by our conflict first with fascism and then with communism. Interweaving the story of intellectual debates with the international history of the twentieth century, Gleason traces the birth of the term to Italy in the first years of Mussolini's rule. Created by Mussolini's enemies, the word was appropriated by the Fascists themselves to describe their program in what turned out to be one of the less totalitarian of the European dictatorships. He follows the growth and expansion of the concept as it was picked up in the West and applied to Hitler's Germany and the Soviet Union. Gleason's account takes us through the debates of the early postwar years, as academics in turn adopted the term--notably Hannah Arendt. The idea of totalitarianism came to possess novelists such as Arthur Koestler (<em>Darkness at Noon</em>) and George Orwell (whose <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> was interpreted by conservatives as an attack on socialism in general, and subsequently suffered criticism from left-leaning critics). The concept fully entered the public consciousness with the opening of the Cold War, as Truman used the rhetoric of totalitarianism to sell the Truman Doctrine to Congress. Gleason takes a fascinating look at the notorious brainwashing episodes of the Korean War, which convinced Americans that Communist China too was a totalitarian state. As he takes his account through to the 1990s, he offers an inner history of the Cold War, revealing the political charge the term carried for writers on both the left and right. He also explores the intellectual struggles that swirled around the idea in France, Germany, Italy, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. When the Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s, Gleason writes, the concept lost much of its importance in the West even as it flourished in Russia, where writers began to describe their own collapsing state as totalitarian--though left-wing Western thinkers had long resisted doing so.<br> Abbott Gleason is a leading scholar of Soviet and Russian history and a contributor to periodicals ranging from <em>The Russian Review</em> to <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>. In this stimulating intellectual history, he offers a revealing look at one of the central concepts of modern times.</p><p>Gleason&#39;s study of totalitarianism is an outstanding treatment of the complex and contentious subject. What gives it special value is that it contains a thoughtful and succinct analysis of the theories of totalitarianism and at the same time deals equally successfully with the practical politics of totalitarian systems and states.Totalitarianism offers a penetrating chronicle of the central concept of our era--an era shaped by our conflict first with fascism and then with communism. Interweaving the story of intellectual debates with the international history of the twentieth century, Gleason traces the birth of the term to Italy in the first years of Mussolini&#39;s rule.</p><h2>Cultural Competence in Process and Practice: Building Bridges</h2><p><p> <b>Now more than ever, the populations social workers must be trained to work with represent the broadest spectrum of humanity &#x2014; in ethnicity,culture, race, religion, worldview, gender, sexual orientation, ability, and in life experiences. </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This text will prepare students to work with any population they will encounter in their professional career.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's divided into 3 parts; Unit 1 covers social work processes, Unit 2 contains student case examples, and unit 3 contains student&nbsp;exercises.</p></p><p></p><h2>Research Methods in Information</h2><p>Fully updated for today s research environments, the long-awaited second edition of Alison Jane Pickard's best-selling handbook includes brand new coverage of online research methods and techniques, mixed methodology and qualitative analysis.

Theology and Ethics</h2><p><p>"<i>Ethics from a Theocentric Perspective</i> will surprise some, shock others, and unleash a flood of speculation about what has happened to James Gustafson. The answer quite simply is nothing has happened to Gustafson except that he has now turned his attention to developing his constructive theological position, and we should all be very glad. . . . In this, the first of two volumes, Gustafson displays his colors as a constructive theologian, and they are indeed brilliant and splendid. . . . Though Gustafson is a theologian who works in the Christian tradition, he reminds us that the God Christians worship is not merely the Christian God. For Gustafson the kind of God who is the object of the theologians's reflection eludes or surpasses the inevitably confessional activity of Christian theological reflection. Thus Gustafson, the constructive theologian, is also Gustafson the revisionist theologian who takes as his task nothing less than challenging the anthropocentrism that he alleges characterizes mainstream Western Christian theology."&#x2014;Stanley Hauerwas, <i>Journal of Religion</i><br></p></p><p><b>James M.

Dr. Wiles demonstrates to a group of stunned mathematicians that he has provided the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem (the equation x" + y" = z", where <i>n</i> is an integer greater than 2, has no solution in positive numbers), a problem that has confounded scholars for over 350 years.</p><p>Here in this brilliant new book, Marilyn vos Savant, the person with the highest recorded IQ in the world explains the mathematical underpinnings of Wiles's solution, discusses the history of Fermat's Last Theorem and other great math problems, and provides colorful stories of the great thinkers and amateurs who attempted to solve Fermat's puzzle.</p></p><p><p><b>Marilyn vos Savant</b>'s "Ask Marilyn" column is featured in <i>Parade</i> magazine every Sunday. She lives in New York City.</p><p>&#x201c;A delightful, informative, and accurate book about the probable proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. [This book is] highly recommended even to readers who think they hate math.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Martin Gardner</i></p><p>&#x201c;Within a few minutes of the conclusion of his [Dr. Wiles's] final lecture, computer mail messages were winging around the world as mathematicians alerted each other to the startling and wholly unexpected result.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>the New York Times</i></p></p><h2>A House in Gross Disorder: Sex, Law, and the 2nd Earl of Castlehaven</h2><p>Sex, privilege, corruption, and revenge--these are elements that we expect to find splashed across today's tabloid headlines. But in 17th century England, a sex scandal in which the 2nd Earl of Castlehaven was executed for crimes so horrible that "a Christian man ought scarce to name them" threatened the very foundations of aristocratic hierarchy.<br> In <em>A House in Gross Disorder</em>, Cynthia Herrup presents a strikingly new interpretation both of the case itself and of the sexual and social anxieties it cast into such bold relief. Castlehaven was convicted of abetting the rape of his wife and of committing sodomy with his servants. More than that, he stood accused of inverting the natural order of his household by reveling in rather than restraining the intemperate passions of those he was expected to rule and protect. Herrup argues that because an orderly house was considered both an example and endorsement of aristocratic governance, the riotousness presided over by Castlehaven was the most damning evidence against him. Castlehaven himself argued that he was the victim of an impatient son, an unhappy wife, and courtiers greedy for his lands. Eschewing simple conclusions about guilt or innocence, Herrup focuses instead on the fascinating legal, social and political dynamics of the case and its subsequent retellings.<br> In prose as riveting as the moral and legal dramas it depicts, <em>A House in Gross Disorder</em> reconsiders a scandal that still speaks to contemporary anxieties about sex, good governance, and the role of law in regulating both.</p><p><br><strong>Cynthia Herrup</strong> is Professor of History and Law, Duke University. She is the former editor of the <em>Journal of British Studies</em> and the author of <em>The Common Peace: Participation and the Criminal Law in 17th Century England</em>. She lives in Durham, North Carolina.<br>A mildly interesting analysis of the 1631 trial of the infamous earl of Castlehaven, who was beheaded for sodomy and rape. Herrup, professor of law and history at Duke, takes us back to Stuart England to explore the legal, social, and political implications of the Castlehaven trial. Castlehaven's household was a paragon of family dysfunction. The earl favored his male servants over his own son, encouraged one servant to rape his wife, and engaged in sodomy with the house staff. Herrup theorizes that the case against Castlehaven went far beyond these shocking allegations, tapping into deep-seated cultural anxieties about power and hierarchy. Castlehaven's inability to control his own sexual urges, combined with his failure to regulate his household, was viewed as undermining the established social order. Thus, King Charles I prosecuted the ``disorderly'' Castlehaven as a lesson for those in power. At trial, the specific facts of the case were largely ignored in favor of arguments about how Castlehaven's misconduct tended to endanger social harmony. The crown's prosecutors also harped on Castlehaven's alleged Catholicism to cast him as a dangerous outsider. Herrup's contention that a high-profile trial can transcend its factual circumstances is hardly groundbreaking. What a particular trial is ``about,'' what it means in a larger cultural context, depends largely on the interpreter: sensational trials fascinate us because they have many subtexts. While Herrup skillfully examines the different meanings given to the Castlehaven trial over time, what she doesn't do particularly well is flesh out the individuals involved or place them in a convincing historical context. Scholars of Stuart England will find much here that's intellectually provocative, especially in the realm where law and social history meet, but the general reader will want a bit more human drama mixed in with the intellectual abstractions.

Kevin Bales's disturbing story of slavery today reaches from brick kilns in Pakistan and brothels in Thailand to the offices of multinational corporations. His investigation of conditions in Mauritania, Brazil, Thailand, Pakistan, and India reveals the tragic emergence of a "new slavery," one intricately linked to the global economy. The new slaves are not a long-term investment as was true with older forms of slavery, explains Bales. Instead, they are cheap, require little care, and are disposable.<br><br>Three interrelated factors have helped create the new slavery. The enormous population explosion over the past three decades has flooded the world's labor markets with millions of impoverished, desperate people. The revolution of economic globalization and modernized agriculture has dispossessed poor farmers, making them and their families ready targets for enslavement. And rapid economic change in developing countries has bred corruption and violence, destroying social rules that might once have protected the most vulnerable individuals.<br><br>Bales's vivid case studies present actual slaves, slaveholders, and public officials in well-drawn historical, geographical, and cultural contexts. He observes the complex economic relationships of modern slavery and is aware that liberation is a bitter victory for a child prostitute or a bondaged miner if the result is starvation.<br><br>Bales offers suggestions for combating the new slavery and provides examples of very positive results from organizations such as Anti-Slavery International, the Pastoral Land Commission in Brazil, and the Human Rights Commission in Pakistan. He also calls for researchers to follow the flow of raw materials and products from slave to marketplace in order to effectively target campaigns of "naming and shaming" corporations linked to slavery. <i>Disposable People</i> is the first book to point the way to abolishing slavery in today's global economy.<br><br><b>All of the author's royalties from this book go to fund anti-slavery projects around the world.</b></p><p>The horror of slavery, says Kevin Bales, is "not confined to history." It is not only possible that slave labor is responsible for the shoes on your feet or your daily consumption of sugar, he writes, the products of forced labor filter even more quietly into a broad portion of daily Western life. "They made the bricks for the factory that made the TV you watch. In Brazil slaves made the charcoal that tempered the steel that made the springs in your car and the blade on your lawnmower.... Slaves keep your costs low and returns on your investments high." <p> The exhaustive research in <i>Disposable People</i> shows that at least 27 million people are currently enslaved around the world. Bales, considered the world's leading expert on contemporary slavery, reveals the historical and economic conditions behind this resurgence. From Thailand, Mauritania, Brazil, Pakistan, and India, Bales has gathered stories of people in unthinkable conditions, kept in bondage to support their owners' lives. Bales insists that even a small effort from a large number of people could end slavery, and devotes a large chapter to explaining the practical means by which this might be accomplished. "Are we willing to live in a world with slaves?" he asks. As a sign of his commitment, all his royalties from <i>Disposable People</i> will go toward the fight against slavery. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>"Convincing, emotionally wrenching, and freighted with appropriate moral indignation, Kevin Bales's startling presentation shows us that while the general public is convinced slavery is a historical phenomenon of the ancient past . . . it is in actuality a widespread tragedy found worldwide and on a large scale. This book innovatively and usefully describes the permutations of an ancient tradition as it exists in this modern day and age."&#x2014;Richard Pierre Claude, editor of <i>Human Rights Quarterly</i><br><br>"A timely and fascinating book . . . of crucial importance. Few people realize that the increasing globalization of the economy has led to the use of coerced labor in many parts of the globe. . . . Bales has traveled widely and has gathered a great amount of shocking and disturbing information."&#x2014;David Brion Davis, Director, Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery and Abolition, Yale University<br><br>"A well-researched, scholarly and deeply disturbing expos� of modern-day slavery with well-thought-out strategies for what to do to combat this scourge. None of us is allowed the luxury of imagined impotence. We can do something about it."&#x2014;Desmond Tutu<br><br>"<i>Ending Slavery</i> takes the critical next step of providing a practical road-map for ending one of the worst human rights abuses of the modern era. Using a common sense approach, Bales offers a clear, economic rationale for why slavery is not as profitable or sustainable as fair labor practices. In addition, this book shows that the solutions for such severe suffering are not simply the purview of the social sector but are opportunities for transformation among policy makers and business people around the world. Bales shows how we can all play a role, and he inspires each of us to take action."&#x2014;Pam Omidyar, Founder, Humanity United, Co-founder, Omidyar Network</p><h2>The American Story: Penguin, Combined Volume (5th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Focuses students on the&nbsp;story of American history.&nbsp;</i> </b> </p> <p> <b> <i>&nbsp;</i> </b> </p> <p> <i>The American Story</i> integrates the social and political dimensions of American history into one chronological narrative, providing students with a full picture of the scope and complexity of the American past.

You can never get rid of ants because they form an animal rhizome that can rebound time and again after most of it has been destroyed... There is a rupture in the rhizome whenever segmentary lines explode into a line of flight, but the line of flight is part of the rhizome. That is why one can never posit a dualism or a dichotomy, even in the rudimentary form of the good and the bad. You may make a rupture, draw a line of flight, yet there still is a danger that you will stratify again everything, from Oedipal resurgences to fascist concretions. Groups and individuals contain microfascisms just waiting to crystallize. Yes, couch grass is also a rhizome.</p><p>Edited by Sylvere Lotringer, <i>On the Line</i> was the first book published in the new "Foreign Agents" series in 1983. It gathers together two seminal texts that Deleuze and Guattari would later elaborate on in A Thousand Plateaus. First delivered in French by Deleuze (drawing graphs on the blackboard) at the "Schizo-Culture" conference organized by Semiotext(e) at Columbia University in 1975, "Rhizome" introduced a new kind of thinking in philosophy, both non-dialectical and non-hierarchical. The two didn't expect this neo-anarchical blue-print would eventually offer an early template for the understanding of the internet. "Rhizome" substitutes pragmatic, "couch grass," free-floating logic to the binary, oppositional, and exclusive model of the tree. In "Politics," superceding the Marxist concept of class, Deleuze envisages the social macrocosm as a series of lines, and reinvent politics as a process of flux whose outcome will always be unpredictable. It is, he emphasizes, the end of the idea of revolution, but not of the "becoming revolutionary." Throughout, he keeps dispelling the notion of capitalism as a repressive machine only meant to extract surplus value from exploited workers and suggest that it could be opposed from within by redirecting the creativity and multiplicity of its flows.The multiple must be made, not always by adding another dimension, rather in the simplest way, by dint of sobriety... A rhizome as subterranean stem is absolutely different from roots and radices. Bulbs and tubers are rhizomes... Even some animals are, in their pack forms. Rats are rhizomes. Burrows are too, in all their function of shelter, supply, movement, evasion and breakout... The rhizome includes the best and the worst: potato and couch grass.</p></p><p>Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII, Vincennes/Saint Denis. He published 25 books, including five in collaboration with F�lix Guattari.</p><h2>Cracking the AP Calculus AB Exam, 2016 Edition (College Test Preparation)</h2><p><b><b>EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO SCORE A PERFECT 5.

Though Schweitzer's own proposals about Jesus no longer command assent, his lasting contribution, comprising the bulk of the book, is the critique of his predecessors. Through examining the works of more than 50 18th- and 19th-century authors and scholars, he shows conclusively that each historical reconstruction of Jesus was largely a fantasy made in their own self-image.<br>Schweitzer's work has proved the touchstone for all subsequent quests for the "Jesus of history."

Born in Venice, Italy, Beato came of age in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople. As a young apprentice in 1856, he photographed the sites of the Crimean War, thereby launching a long and remarkably adventurous career. Over the next half century he would follow in the wake of the British Empire: Egypt, Palestine, and Syria; India, where he photographed the aftermath of the Indian Mutiny; and China, where he chronicled the Second Opium War. He spent some thirty years in Japan and Burma, where he was among the first commercial photographers at the time that these countries were starting to open to the West.</p><p>The text includes an engaging narrative of his life and entrepreneurial career and a thought-provoking essay on Beato and the photography of war. There is a generous selection of his photographs, including panoramas and hand-colored Japanese studies, along with captivating period ephemera, lithographs based on his work, and humorous caricatures of the artist.</p></p><p><p>Anne Lacoste, assistant curator in the Department of Photographs at the J.

Fred Ritchin, former photograph editor of the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, is professor of photography and imaging at New York University&#x2019;s Tisch School of the Arts and author of <i>After Photography and In Our Own Image: The Coming Revolution in Photography</i>.</p>Born in Venice, raised in then British Corfu, and apprenticed to an English photographer during the Crimean War, Beato (1832&#x2013;1909) was perhaps the first international photojournalist. He lived for more than 20 years in Japan during its first decades of modernization, and also spent significant periods in India, China, and Burma. This book, the catalogue for a current exhibit, includes 120 samples of his work, along with an excellent short biography and appreciation by Lacoste (coauthor of Irving Penn), the Getty&#x2122;s assistant curator of photography. An equally fine shorter piece is by Ritchin, former photography editor of the New York Times Magazine, on Beato&#x2122;s war photography (he covered battles in at least five wars), images of which are included, some almost unbearably graphic, such as one of a corpse-strewn fort that British soldiers conquered during the Second Opium War. Particularly striking are Beato&#x2122;s wide variety of Asian cities and forts, and his staged shots of locals in native dress&#x2014;although readers will likely crave added context for his subjects. These beautifully presented and explained images will appeal to students of both 19th-century photography and Western imperialist sensibility in the Far East. (Dec.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

The story revolves around the moral dilemmas of a Polish prince, unjustly imprisoned by his suspicious father. Against a background of revolution, Calder�n builds a dramatic edifice of outstanding theatricality, rich in symbolism and metaphor, expressed in magnificent poetry.<br>This excellent new English translation is absolutely complete, and as close and direct as possible. Ample footnotes and an informative introductory Publisher's Note enhance the value of its modest price.</p><p></p></p><p><b>PEDRO CALDERON DE LA BARCA</b> (1600&#x2013;1681) was one of the leading dramatists of the Spanish Golden Age. His father was Secretary to the Royal Treasury and a minor noble, and his mother was a devoutly religious woman who died when he was a child. Calder�n studied canon law in preparation for his presumed career in the church, but in the 1620s he started to write verse, and his success in competitions attracted attention. The first known staging of one of his plays was a 1623 performance of <i>Amor, Honor, Poder</i> (<i>Love, Honor, and Power</i>). Eventually, the prolific Calder�n would write approximately 120 full-length dramatic works, 80 one-act autos sacramentales (religious mystery plays), and many other short pieces of poetry and theater. In 1636 King Philip IV named him a knight of the Order of Santiago. His output lessened in the 1640s, and in 1651 Calder�n entered the priesthood, becoming chaplain of the Capilla de los Reyes Nuevos at the cathedral in Toledo, and then, in 1656, head of the congregation of San Pedro in Madrid.

First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric: The Use of Reason in Everyday Life</h2><p>This classic text, first published in 1971, has introduced tens of thousands of students to sound reasoning using a wealth of current, relevant, and stimulating examples all put together and explained in Howard Kahane&#39;s uniquely witty and invigorating writing style.

Yet it has not been an easy path; military catastrophe, political atrophy, and economic upheavals have made regular appearances from the feudal era to the present. Today, Japan is seen as a has-been with a sluggish economy, an aging population, dysfunctional politics, and a business landscape dominated by yesterday's champions. Though it is supposed to be America's strongest ally in the Asia-Pacific region, it has almost entirely disappeared from the American radar screen. <br><br>In <em>Japan and the Shackles of the Past</em>, R. Taggart Murphy places the current troubles of Japan in a sweeping historical context, moving deftly from early feudal times to the modern age that began with the Meiji Restoration. Combining fascinating analyses of Japanese culture and society over the centuries with hard-headed accounts of Japan's numerous political regimes, Murphy not only reshapes our understanding of Japanese history, but of Japan's place in the contemporary world. He concedes that Japan has indeed been out of sight and out of mind in recent decades, but contends that this is already changing. Political and economic developments in Japan today risk upheaval in the pivotal arena of Northeast Asia, inviting comparisons with Europe on the eve of the First World War. America's half-completed effort to remake Japan in the late 1940s is unraveling, and the American foreign policy and defense establishment is directly culpable for what has happened. The one apparent exception to Japan's malaise is the vitality of its pop culture, but it's actually no exception at all; rather, it provides critical clues to what is going on now. <br><br>With insights into everything from Japan's politics and economics to the texture of daily life, gender relations, the changing business landscape, and popular and high culture, <em>Japan and the Shackles of the Past</em> is the indispensable guide to understanding Japan in all its complexity.<br></p><p><br><strong>R. Taggart Murphy</strong> is Professor of International Political Economy at the MBA Program in International Business at the Tokyo campus of the University of Tsukuba. He is the author of award-winning books on modern Japan and a number of articles in publications from <em>The New Republic</em> to the <em>National</em> <em>Interest</em> and <em>The New Left Review</em>. A former investment banker, he has also taught at the university's main campus, was a Non-Resident Senior Visiting Fellow at the Brookings Institution, and is a coordinator of the web's leading clearing-house for serious writing on Japan, <em>Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan</em> <em>Focus</em>.<br><br>"Tag Murphy knows so much about Japan that he can be elegantly spare and thematic in his analysis. He clearly loves the people there so much that he can be highly critical of many of their institutions. He is so serious about the country that he can be playful and earthy in his approach. This is a very well-informed, equally well-written book that I highly recommend to anyone dealing with or thinking about Japan." --James Fallows, <em>The Atlantic</em><p></p><br>"When I started visiting Japan in the early 1990s, I looked for a book that would explain to me the country's history. I wasn't interested in what restaurant to visit, or in a dry recitation of dynastic succession, but in the historical interplay of the country's politics, economics, and culture, Taggart Murphy, who previously wrote a definitive study of Japan's bubble economy, has written that book, and it comes as well with a provocative thesis about the breakdown of the American relationship with Japan. Anyone interested in Japan or in the U.S.-Japan relationship should read this book." --John Judis, Senior Editor, <em>The New Republic</em><p></p><br>"Japan is not a free country, and this book tells you why. It is present-day Washington's biggest and most significant vassal, dwarfing any European country. It has adopted America's enemies to its own detriment, inviting future disaster for the region and possibly the world. By the time that Murphy's book gets to that crucial part of recent history, not yet told in any other book, he readies the reader for these shackles by offering a tapestry of the integrated political-economic strands, along with cultural institutions, under the feet of Japan's bureaucrats, politicians, bankers and industrialists." --Karel van Wolferen, author of <em>The Enigma of Japanese Power</em><p></p><br>"Murphy sheds much light on Japan's current dependence upon the U.S. for maintenance of its political system and its future prospects, closing with an in-depth analysis of the current administration." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>All Souls</h2><p>Winner of the 1990 Cuidad de Barcelona Prize, this story traces an affair that develops between a visiting Spanish lecturer at Oxford and a beautiful tutor. While the lecturer wishes to keep the affair secret, the tutor is intent on strewing evidence everywhere, even in front of her husband.</p><p>Javier Marias is the author of sixteen works in Spanish, which have been translated into forty-two languages including English. His translated English works are All Souls, A Heart So White, Tomorrow in the Battle Think on Me, When I Was Mortal, Dark Back of Time, The Man of Feeling, Voyage Along the Horizon, Written Lives, the Your Face Tomorrow trilogy (Fever and Spear, Dance and Dream and Poison, Shadow and Farewell), Bad Nature, While the Women Are Sleeping, The Infatuations, Thus Bad Begins and, Venice, An Interior. Javier Marias has received numerous literary prizes including the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and the Prix Formentor. He lives and works as a translator and columnist in Madrid.The first US appearance of an accomplished and elegant novel, first published in Spain in 1990, by the author of A Heart So White (p. 18) and other highly praised fiction. Set in Oxford, and drenched in the ambience of academic myopia and departmental power politics, it recounts in polished Jamesian prose the two-year lectureship enjoyed and endured there by its narrator, a visiting Spanish scholar. He encounters an alluring married woman tutor whose affair with him piques her conscience rather less than it does his. She, in fact, can't even be bothered to keep silent about their intimacy. Other complications are provided by a richly observed bevy of colleagues who exhibit most of the commoner academic and British eccentricities (notable among them are an economist who will discourse at length about his obsession with an 18th-century cider tax, and a professor of literature who moonlights as a successful author of ``horror blockbusters''). There's little plot beyond the (unnamed) narrator's romantic intriguing, but it's a rare civilized pleasure to overhear his incisive analyses of cultural, temperamental, and sexual differences between Britons and Iberians, or to follow his peregrinations through the meaner streets of Oxford (whose beggars elicit a feeling of kinship in this deracinated wanderer) or several antiquarian bookstores, ever in search of the odd and engaging. The novel is as much a record of life at Oxford as it is a narrative. Its characters, though vividly drawn, are really little more than functional, especially as measured against Mar�as's only real character creation here: his thoughtful protagonist, whose confusions and insights alike more often than not sparkle with the brilliance of aphorism (``In Oxford the only thing anyone is truly interested in is money, followed some way behind by information, which can always be useful as a means of acquiring money'')--translated with deadpan clarity and precision by the ever-dependable Costa. Another stunning work from one of Europe's best younger writers. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This book distils the lessons she has learned and suggests strategies to make child welfare programs, and particularly child protection services, more effective in their work with families from diverse backgrounds and cultures. Fontes's writing is concise and to the point. She uses examples to illustrate major concepts and then describes practical steps agencies and individual workers can take to maximize their effectiveness.

Edleson, PhD, Dean and Professor, School of Social Welfare, University of California, Berkeley<br><br> "Well written and organized, this book provides practical ideas for making child protection services equitable for families from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds--a topic that cannot be ignored in our multicultural societies. Grounding the work in a solid theoretical framework, Fontes sensitively addresses the various issues involved in making services and agencies culturally competent. This book is an essential read for undergraduate and graduate students in social work and related fields, as well as for practitioners and researchers."--Sarah Maiter, PhD, School of Social Work, Wilfrid Laurier University, Canada<br><br> "Dr. Fontes expertly interweaves the importance of using a cultural framework with practical suggestions for working with children and families. This book fills a key gap in the professional literature. Novice as well as experienced clinicians will find this book useful in helping them examine the cultural attitudes, biases, and strengths that affect their assessment, intervention, consultation, prevention, and training roles, particularly in relation to child maltreatment issues."--David A. Wolfe, PhD, Center for Addiction and Mental Health, London, Ontario, Canada<br><br> "Highly readable and instructive, this is an indispensable how-to guide for professionals and trainees in child protection services, hospitals, schools, and mental health programs. Fontes offers essential resources in the form of interviewing techniques and individual, group, and community approaches that are sensitive to ethnicity, race, social class, and gender. Fontes is compassionate and evenhanded--fair to all those involved with the difficult and life--transforming decisions precipitated by family violence in diverse populations."--Celia Jaes Falicov, PhD, past president, American Family Therapy Academy<br><br> "Children and families identified and served by the child welfare system are racially, ethnically, and culturally diverse. Moreover, children of color are disproportionately reported to child protection services and over represented in the child welfare system. This timely, informative book is thoughtful and inclusive, drawing on the literature on race, culture, and ethnicity as well as the child welfare literature. Fontes makes excellent use of illustrative case examples from the literature and her own practice experience.

Verlyn Klinkenborg chronicles the life of a family-owned restaurant in Buffalo, New York, from its days as a prewar Polish tavern to its reincarnation as George &amp; Eddie's, a swank nightspot serving highballs and French-fried shrimp to a generation of optimistic and prosperous Americans. In the inevitable dimming of the neon sign outside the restaurant, we see both the passing of an old world way of life and the end to the postwar exuberance that was Eddie Wenzek's "last fine time."</p></p><p><b>Verlyn Kilnkenborg</b> comes from a family of Iowa farmers.

The book has two equally significant goals. The first is to help students develop mathematical thinking skills, particularly theorem-proving skills. The other goal is to help students understand some of the wonderfully rich ideas in the mathematical study of numbers. This book is appropriate for a proof transitions course, for independent study, or for a course designed as an introduction to abstract mathematics. It is designed to be used with an instructional technique variously called guided discovery or Modified Moore Method or Inquiry Based Learning (IBL). Instructors&#39; materials explain the instructional method, which gives students a totally different experience compared to a standard lecture course. Students develop an attitude of personal reliance and a sense that they can think effectively about difficult problems; goals that are fundamental to the educational enterprise within and beyond mathematics.</p><p>This innovative textbook leads students on a carefully guided discovery of introductory number theory.

He was a remarkable man even by what was known of him; and that was but a small part of what he actually did. Although of a placid temper in ordinary circumstances, and accustomed to take the world with as much philosophy as any ploughman, the Prince of Bohemia was not without a taste for ways of life more adventurous and eccentric than that to which he was destined by his birth. Now and then, when he fell into a low humour, when there was no laughable play to witness in any of the London theatres, and when the season of the year was unsuitable to those field sports in which he excelled all competitors, he would summon his confidant and Master of the Horse, Colonel Geraldine, and bid him prepare himself against an evening ramble. The Master of the Horse was a young officer of a brave and even temerarious disposition. He greeted the news with delight, and hastened to make ready. Long practice and a varied acquaintance of life had given him a singular facility in disguise; he could adapt not only his face and bearing, but his voice and almost his thoughts, to those of any rank, character, or nation; and in this way he diverted attention from the Prince, and sometimes gained admission for the pair into strange societies. The civil authorities were never taken into the secret of these adventures; the imperturbable courage of the one and the ready invention and chivalrous devotion of the other had brought them through a score of dangerous passes; and they grew in confidence as time went on.<br><br>One evening in March they were driven by a sharp fall of sleet into an Oyster Bar in the immediate neighbourhood of Leicester Square. Colonel Geraldine was dressed and painted to represent a person connected with the Press in reduced circumstances; while the Prince had, as usual, travestied his appearance by the addition of false whiskers and a pair of large adhesive eyebrows. These lent him a shaggy and weather-beaten air, which, for one of his urbanity, formed the most impenetrable disguise. Thus equipped, the commander and his satellite sipped their brandy and soda in security.<br><br>The bar was full of guests, male and female; but though more than one of these offered to fall into talk with our adventurers, none of them promised to grow interesting upon a nearer acquaintance. There was nothing present but the lees of London and the commonplace of disrespectability; and the Prince had already fallen to yawning, and was beginning to grow weary of the whole excursion, when the swing doors were pushed violently open, and a young man, followed by a couple of commissionaires, entered the bar. Each of the commissionaires carried a large dish of cream tarts under a cover, which they at once removed; and the young man made the round of the company, and pressed these confections upon everyone's acceptance with an exaggerated courtesy. Sometimes his offer was laughingly accepted; sometimes it was firmly, or even harshly, rejected. In these latter cases the newcomer always ate the tart himself, with some more or less humorous commentary.<br><br>At last he accosted Prince Florizel.<br><br>"Sir," said he, with a profound obeisance, proffering the tart at the same time between his thumb and forefinger, "will you so far honour an entire stranger? I can answer for the quality of the pastry, having eaten two dozen and three of them myself since five o'clock."<br><br>"I am in the habit," replied the Prince, "of looking not so much to the nature of a gift as to the spirit in which it is offered."<br><br>"The spirit, sir," returned the young man, with another bow, "is one of mockery."<br><br>"Mockery?" repeated Florizel. "And whom do you propose to mock?"<br><br>"I am not here to expound my philosophy," replied the other, "but to distribute these cream tarts. If I mention that I heartily include myself in the ridicule of the transaction, I hope you will consider honour satisfied and condescend. If not, you will constrain me to eat my twenty-eighth, and I own to being weary of the exercise."<br><br>"You touch me," said the Prince, "and I have all the will in the world to rescue you from this dilemma, but upon one condition. If my friend and I eat your cakes-for which we have neither of us any natural inclination-we shall expect you to join us at supper by way of recompense."<br><br>The young man seemed to reflect.<br><br>"I have still several dozen upon hand," he said at last; "and that will make it necessary for me to visit several more bars before my great affair is concluded. This will take some time; and if you are hungry--"<br><br>The Prince interrupted him with a polite gesture.<br><br>"My friend and I will accompany you," he said; "for we have already a deep interest in your very agreeable mode of passing an evening. And now that the preliminaries of peace are settled, allow me to sign the treaty for both."<br><br>And the Prince swallowed the tart with the best grace imaginable.<br><br>"It is delicious," said he.<br><br>"I perceive you are a connoisseur," replied the young man.<br><br>Colonel Geraldine likewise did honour to the pastry; and everyone in that bar having now either accepted or refused his delicacies, the young man with the cream tarts led the way to another and similar establishment. The two commissionaires, who seemed to have grown accustomed to their absurd employment, followed immediately after; and the Prince and the Colonel brought up the rear, arm in arm, and smiling to each other as they went. In this order the company visited two other taverns, where scenes were enacted of a like nature to that already described-some refusing, some accepting, the favours of this vagabond hospitality, and the young man himself eating each rejected tart.<br><br>On leaving the third saloon the young man counted his store. There were but nine remaining, three in one tray and six in the other.<br><br>"Gentlemen," said he, addressing himself to his two new followers, "I am unwilling to delay your supper. I am positively sure you must be hungry. I feel that I owe you a special consideration. And on this great day for me, when I am closing a career of folly by my most conspicuously silly action, I wish to behave handsomely to all who give me countenance. Gentlemen, you shall wait no longer. Although my constitution is shattered by previous excesses, at the risk of my life I liquidate the suspensory condition."<br><br>With these words he crushed the nine remaining tarts into his mouth, and swallowed them at a single movement each. Then, turning to the commissionaires, he gave them a couple of sovereigns.<br><br>"I have to thank you," said he, "for your extraordinary patience."<br><br>And he dismissed them with a bow apiece. For some seconds he stood looking at the purse from which he had just paid his assistants, then, with a laugh, he tossed it into the middle of the street, and signified his readiness for supper.<br><br>In a small French restaurant in Soho, which had enjoyed an exaggerated reputation for some little while, but had already begun to be forgotten, and in a private room up two pair of stairs, the three companions made a very elegant supper, and drank three or four bottles of champagne, talking the while upon indifferent subjects. The young man was fluent and gay, but he laughed louder than was natural in a person of polite breeding; his hands trembled violently, and his voice took sudden and surprising inflections, which seemed to be independent of his will. The dessert had been cleared away, and all three had lighted their cigars, when the Prince addressed him in these words:<br><br>"You will, I am sure, pardon my curiosity. What I have seen of you has greatly pleased but even more puzzled me. And though I should be loth to seem indiscreet, I must tell you that my friend and I are persons very well worthy to be entrusted with a secret. We have many of our own, which we are continually revealing to improper ears. And if, as I suppose, your story is a silly one, you need have no delicacy with us, who are two of the silliest men in England. My name is Godall, Theophilus Godall; my friend is Major Alfred Hammersmith-or at least, such is the name by which he chooses to be known. We pass our lives entirely in the search for extravagant adventures; and there is no extravagance with which we are not capable of sympathy."<br><br>"I like you, Mr. Godall," returned the young man; "you inspire me with a natural confidence; and I have not the slightest objection to your friend the Major, whom I take to be a nobleman in masquerade. At least, I am sure he is no soldier."<br><br>The Colonel smiled at this compliment to the perfection of his art; and the young man went on in a more animated manner.<br><br>"There is every reason why I should not tell you my story. Perhaps that is just the reason why I am going to do so. At least, you seem so well prepared to hear a tale of silliness that I cannot find it in my heart to disappoint you. My name, in spite of your example, I shall keep to myself. My age is not essential to the narrative. I am descended from my ancestors by ordinary generation, and from them I inherited the very eligible human tenement which I still occupy and a fortune of three hundred pounds a year. I suppose they also handed on to me a harebrain humour, which it has been my chief delight to indulge. I received a good education. I can play the violin nearly well enough to earn money in the orchestra of a penny gaff, but not quite. The same remark applies to the flute and the French horn. I learned enough of whist to lose about a hundred a year at that scientific game. My acquaintance with French was sufficient to enable me to squander money in Paris with almost the same facility as in London. In short, I am a person full of manly accomplishments. I have had every sort of adventure, including a duel about nothing. Only two months ago I met a young lady exactly suited to my taste in mind and body; I found my heart melt; I saw that I had come upon my fate at last, and was in the way to fall in love. But when I came to reckon up what remained to me of my capital, I found it amounted to something less than four hundred pounds! I ask you fairly-can a man who respects himself fall in love on four hundred pounds? I concluded, certainly not; left the presence of my charmer, and slightly accelerating my usual rate of expenditure, came this morning to my last eighty pounds. This I divided into two equal parts; forty I reserved for a particular purpose; the remaining forty I was to dissipate before the night. I have passed a very entertaining day, and played many farces besides that of the cream tarts which procured me the advantage of your acquaintance; for I was determined, as I told you, to bring a foolish career to a still more foolish conclusion; and when you saw me throw my purse into the street, the forty pounds were at an end. Now you know me as well as I know myself: a fool but consistent in his folly; and, as I will ask you to believe, neither a whimperer nor a coward."<br><br>From the whole tone of the young man's statement it was plain that he harboured very bitter and contemptuous thoughts about himself. His auditors were led to imagine that his love affair was nearer his heart than he admitted, and that he had a design on his own life. The farce of the cream tarts began to have very much the air of a tragedy in disguise.<br><br>"Why, is this not odd," broke out Geraldine, giving a look to Prince Florizel, "that we three fellows should have met by the merest accident in so large a wilderness as London, and should be so nearly in the same condition?"<br><br>"How?" cried the young man. "Are you, too, ruined? Is this supper a folly like my cream tarts? Has the devil brought three of his own together for a last carouse?"<br><br>"The devil, depend upon it, can sometimes do a very gentlemanly thing," returned Prince Florizel; "and I am so much touched by this coincidence, that, although we are not entirely in the same case, I am going to put an end to the disparity. Let your heroic treatment of the last cream tarts be my example."<br><br>So saying, the Prince drew out his purse and took from it a small bundle of bank-notes.<br><br>"You see, I was a week or so behind you, but I mean to catch you up and come neck and neck into the winningpost," he continued. "This," laying one of the notes upon the table, "will suffice for the bill. As for the rest--"<br><br>He tossed them into the fire, and they went up the chimney in a single blaze.<br><br>The young man tried to catch his arm, but as the table was between them his interference came too late.<br><br>"Unhappy man," he cried, "you should not have burned them all! You should have kept forty pounds."<br><br>"Forty pounds!" repeated the Prince. "Why, in heaven's name, forty pounds?"<br><br>"Why not eighty?" cried the Colonel; "for to my certain knowledge there must have been a hundred in the bundle."<br><br>"It was only forty pounds he needed," said the young man gloomily. "But without them there is no admission. The rule is strict. Forty pounds for each. Accursed life, where a man cannot even die without money!"<br><br>The Prince and the Colonel exchanged glances.<br><br>"Explain yourself," said the latter. "I have still a pocketbook tolerably well lined, and I need not say how readily I should share my wealth with Godall. But I must know to what end: you must certainly tell us what you mean."<br><br>The young man seemed to awaken; he looked uneasily from one to the other, and his face flushed deeply.<br><br>"You are not fooling me?" he asked. "You are indeed ruined men like me?"<br><br>"Indeed, I am for my part," replied the Colonel.<br><br>"And for mine," said the Prince, "I have given you proof. Who but a ruined man would throw his notes into the fire? The action speaks for itself."</p><h2>The Lives and Times of the Great Composers</h2><p>&#39;A glorious plum-pudding of a book, to be consulted, with pleasure and profit, over and over again&#39; Sir Jeremy Isaacs Michael Steen&#39;s &#39;Great Composers&#39; was originally published in 2003. A lifetime&#39;s work and almost 1000 pages long, it has since become &#39;the&#39; reference point and key read on the biographical backgrounds to classical music&#39;s biggest names. Authoritative and hugely detailed - but nonetheless a joy to read - this new edition will expand its readership further and capitalise on a newfound popular interest in classical music. Steen&#39;s book helps you explore the story of Bach, the respectable burgher much of whose vast output was composed amidst petty turf disputes in Lutheran Leipzig; or the ugly, argumentative Beethoven in French-occupied Vienna, obsessed by his laundry; or Mozart, the over-exploited infant prodigy whose untimely death was shrouded in rumour. Read about Verdi, who composed against the background of the Italian Risorgimento; or about the family life of the Wagners; and, Brahms, who rose from the slums of Hamburg to become a devotee of beer and coffee in fin-de-siecle Vienna, a cultural capital bent on destroying Mahler...and much, much more.</p><p>Michael Steen was born in Dublin, studied at the Royal College of Music, was organ scholar at Oriel College, Oxford and is currently chairman of the Royal College of Music Society.&#39;A glorious plum-pudding of a book, to be consulted, with pleasure and profit, over and over again&#39; -- Sir Jeremy Isaacs &#39;Hugely informative and deliciously gossipy&#39; -- Spectator &#39;Michael Steen&#39;s beautifully illustrated book packs an astonishing amount of biographical and cultural detail into nearly forty subjects.&#39; -- Independent on Sunday</p><h2>Spring: A Spiritual Biography of the Season</h2><p>As winter's austere power begins to fade, we notice the first signs of vigor and life returning to the world: delicate crocuses pushing through the damp earth; frogs croaking in the barely thawed ponds; the year's first warm breeze on our faces. <p> These first sure signs of spring bolster our spirits and remind us of the eternal cycle of death and rebirth, and also--more poignantly--of the steady march of time and our own advancing years. With each successive spring, it seems, we cherish the promise of renewed life more and more. </p><p> These thoughtfully chosen writings, poems and meditations--from Robert Frost, Lisa Couturier, William Blake and Lady Sarashina to the eighth-century Chinese poet Tu Fu and many others--both celebrate spring's re-emergence of life and evoke the season's delicate balance of growth and decay, youth and maturity, innocence and experience.</p></p><p>This diverse collection of writings explores the many facets of spring, from the first breakup of ice on a river in Nova Scotia to the long March rains in Kenya--and invites us each to nurture the stirrings of new life continually emerging in our own souls.Gary Schmidt, a Newbery Award winner, teaches literature at Calvin College.

Spurred by a conviction that the ideal of an anthropological cinema has not even remotely begun to be realized, Ruby argues that ethnographic filmmakers should generate a set of critical standards analogous to those for written ethnographies. Cinematic artistry and the desire to entertain, he argues, can eclipse the original intention, which is to provide an anthropological representation of the subjects.<br> <br> The book begins with analyses of key filmmakers (Robert Flaherty, Robert Garner, and Tim Asch) who have striven to generate profound statements about human behavior on film. Ruby then discusses the idea of research film, Eric Michaels and indigenous media, the ethics of representation, the nature of ethnography, anthropological knowledge, and film and lays the groundwork for a critical approach to the field that borrows selectively from film, communication, media, and cultural studies. Witty and original, yet intensely theoretical, this collection is a major contribution to the field of visual anthropology.</p></p><p><b>Jay Ruby</b>&nbsp;is professor emeritus of anthropology at Temple University and the author or editor of numerous books.</p><h2>Plumed Serpent (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>In this novel, symptomatic of Lawrence&#39;s later work, Kate Leslie, an Irish widow visiting Mexico, finds herself equally repelled and fascinated by what she sees as the primitive cruelty of the country.

Caught up in the plans of these two men to revive the old Aztec religion and political order, she submits to the &#39;blood-consciousness&#39; and phallic power that they represent.</p><p>David Herbert Richards Lawrence (11 September 1885 &#x2013; 2 March 1930) was an English novelist, poet, playwright, essayist, literary critic and painter who published as D.

In them, some of the issues Lawrence explores are emotional health, vitality, spontaneity and instinct.</p><h2>The Cruel Radiance: Photography and Political Violence</h2><p>In <i>The Cruel Radiance</i>, Susie Linfield challenges the idea that photographs of political violence exploit their subjects and pander to the voyeuristic tendencies of their viewers. Instead she argues passionately that looking at such images&#x2014;and learning to <i>see</i> the people in them&#x2014;is an ethically and politically necessary act that connects us to our modern history of violence and probes the human capacity for cruelty.

In the book&#x2019;s concluding section, she examines the indispensable work of Robert Capa, James Nachtwey, and Gilles Peress and asks how photography should respond to the increasingly nihilistic trajectory of modern warfare.A bracing and unsettling book, <i>The Cruel Radiance</i> convincingly demonstrates that if we hope to alleviate political violence, we must first truly understand it&#x2014;and to do that, we must begin to look.</p><p><p></p><b>Susie Linfield</b> has been an editor for <i>American Film</i>, the <i>Village Voice</i>, and the <i>Washington</i><i>Post </i>and has written for a wide range of publications including&nbsp;the <i>Los Angeles</i><i>Times Book Review</i>,the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Bookforum</i>, the <i>Village Voice</i>, <i>Aperture</i>, <i>Dissent</i>, and the <i>Nation</i>.

This should be required reading for students of journalism and political science and general readers with an interest in human-rights activism."</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"To look at a photograph entails a peculiar kind of participation: distanced in time and space, and severely limited in regard to the context leading to and consequences stemming from the moment fixed on film, yet often viscerally affecting. . . . Susie Linfield writes forcefully about this predicament.

Scott Fitzgerald: A New Collection</h2><p>This new collection of forty-three sparkling masterpieces is the first to reflect the phenomenal Fitzgerald revival and reappraisal over the past four decades.</p><p>F. Scott Fitgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896. He attended Princeton University, joined the United States Army during World War I, and published his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise</i>, in 1920. That same year he married Zelda Sayre and the couple divided their time among New York, Paris, and the Riviera. Fitzgerald's masterpieces include <i>The Beautiful and Damned, The Great Gatsby</i>, and <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. He died at the age of forty-four, while working on <i>The Love of the Last Tycoon</i>. Fitzgerald stands out as one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century.Bruccoli's ( Some Sort of Epic Grandeur ) collection of 43 Fitzgerald stories includes 23 not featured in Malcolm Cowley's landmark 1951 collection, expanding the canon of a peerless American writer who was deeply ambivalent about the role of short fiction in his art. Published in commercial magazines (e.g., the Saturday Evening Post ), the stories brought their author as much as $4000 each--but also exacted a price, distracting Fitzgerald from work on his novels. Regardless, many of the stories are unequalled in achievement--inspirited with a delicate wit, a shrewd perception of character and a poetic sense of place--and lead us through Fitzgerald's rich creative chronology, from unforgettable evocations of the enchanting but ruthless social whirl of the young in the 1920s ("Bernice Bobs Her Hair") to the exhaustion of spirit chronicled 16 years later in "Afternoon of an Author." Among the 23 stories, nearly all of which have appeared previously in magazines, is one--"Last Kiss"--published for the first time in the author's final revision. Invaluable to Fitzgerald admirers, Bruccoli's collection should also capture a new generation of readers.

Of special significance are the historical influences of geometry (circle and sphere) and astrology on early interpretations of an assumed finite and closed universe. Glaringly absent is any treatment of the bold cosmologist Giodano Bruno (1548-1600), who argued for an inhabited infinite universe. North focuses on recent advances in instruments (telescope, spectroscope, antenna, camera, rocket) and new theories in physics that have brought about remarkable discoveries in astronomy (quasars, pulsars, supernovae) and dynamic models in cosmology. Also highlighted are the contributions of Kepler, Galileo, Herschel, Hale, Hubble, and Hawking. Essentially an impressive introduction to the history of astronomy but not cosmology, this book is recommended for all academic and public science collections.<br><i>James Birx, Canisius Coll., Buffalo, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hard Times (Macmillan Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>Designed to appeal to the book lover, the Macmillan Collector's Library is a series of beautifully bound pocket-sized gift editions of much loved classic titles. Bound in real cloth, printed on high quality paper, and featuring ribbon markers and gilt edges, Macmillan Collector's Library are books to love and treasure. </p><p><i>Hard Times</i> is perhaps the archetypal Dickens novel, full as it is with family difficulties, estrangement, rotten values and unhappiness. It was published in 1854 and it is the story of the family of Thomas Gradgrind, and occurs in the imaginary Coketown, an industrial city inspired by Preston. Gradgrind is a man obsessed with misguided &#x2018;Utilitarian&#x2019; values that make him trust facts, statistics and practicality more than emotion and is based upon James Mill (the Utilitarian leader). He directs his own children, Louisa and Tom, in this same way: enforcing an artless existence upon them. Contemporary critics such as Macaulay savaged the book for its supposed &#x2018;sullen socialism&#x2019; but it has become well thought-of since the favour of George Bernard Shaw.</p><p>Illustrated by Harry French, with an afterword by David Stuart Davies.</p></p><p>Charles Dickens was born in 1812 near Portsmouth, where his father worked as a clerk. Living in London in 1824, Dickens was sent by his family to work in a blacking-warehouse, and his father was arrested and imprisoned for debt. Fortunes improved and Dickens returned to school, eventually becoming a parliamentary reporter. His first piece of fiction was published by a magazine in December 1832, and by 1836 he had begun his first novel, <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>. He focused his career on writing, completing fourteen highly successful novels, as well as penning journalism, shorter fiction and travel books. He died in 1870.</p><h2>Implementing IT Governance (Best Practice (Van Haren Publishing))</h2><p>The issues, opportunities and challenges of aligning information technology more closely with an organization and effectively governing an organization&#x2019;s Information Technology (IT) investments, resources, major initiatives and superior uninterrupted service is becoming a major concern of the Board and executive management in enterprises on a global basis.

With that rousing proclamation, twelve hundred knights ride into battle, accompanied by the stalwart archers known as the White Company.<br>Fueled by their appetite for glory, this motley crew of freebooters stands united in their unswerving devotion to the company commander, Sir Nigel Loring. Short, bald, and extremely nearsighted, Sir Nigel's unprepossessing appearance belies his warrior's heart and his chivalrous nature. The rollicking adventures of his company during the Hundred Years War center around Sir Nigel's loyal squire, Alleyne Edricson. Raised in the sheltered confines of a monastery, young Alleyne comes of age amid the rough-and-tumble of armed conflict and the bewildering ways of courtly love.<br>Best known as the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was also a passionate historian. The White Company was his favorite among his own works; here, he offers flavorful, realistic depictions of life during the 14th century &#x2014; from its weapons and apparel to its religious practice, and the close connection between the cycles of human existence, and the rhythm of the seasons.

In exploring the question posed by the title, the author introduces and applies such organizing concepts as great power conflict, imperial decline, revolution, ethnic conflict, colonialism, economic development, totalitarian ideology, and transition to democracy in a most accessible way. Questions and controversies, and extracts from documentary and literary sources, anchor the text at key points. This book is intended for use in history and political science courses on the Soviet Union or more generally on the 20th century.</p><p>The reversion of the Soviet Union to Russia has generated a cottage industry of assessments. Strayer (SUNY at Brockport) has produced a nicely written college text on the subject that would be useful to both political science and history students. Narrower in focus than Michael Kort's recent The Soviet Colossus (M.E. Sharpe, 1996. 4th ed.) or Paul Dukes's A History of Russia (Duke Univ., 1998. 3d. ed.), and complementary to Fred Coleman's The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Empire (LJ 5/1/96), Strayer's study not only incorporates basic historical facts but also muses on how historians do their work. Two-thirds of his book deals with the period after Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the mid-1980s, and Strayer thoroughly examines what Gorbachev tried to accomplish and why he failed. Those with a general curiosity about the denouement of the late, great Soviet Union will benefit from Strayer's intelligent survey. For most collections.?Edward Goedeken, Iowa State Univ.

He is the past president of the San Diego Medical Society and the American Psychiatric Association. He is currently a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, and a director at Mercy Hospital, San Diego. Marilyn Martin, MD, is a public health physician and psychoanalyst practicing in Baltimore, Maryland. She is the author of "Saving Your Last Nerve: The Black Woman's Path to Mental Health,"<br>The last nerve is the breaking point many people refer to when stress has pressed them to the limit. Martin, a psychiatrist, explores the particular stresses faced by black women and how they can maintain mental and emotional balance, and find peace of mind. Martin cites statistics on the rise in suicide among black people, and their reluctance to seek professional help because of a historic distrust of the medical establishment and concerns about adding another potential stigma on top of race. Using case studies, Martin broadly analyzes sources of everyday stress and coping mechanisms and resources, including friends, family, church, other social and spiritual organizations, and occasionally medication and professional counseling. She offers guidelines on how to take inventory of mental health, exercises on managing stress, and when and how to seek professional help. While culturally specific to black women, this is a helpful resource for readers seeking guidance on maintaining emotional balance. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Neill&#x2019;s &#x201c;code of freedom&#x201d; emphasized the principles of freedom, love, and positive discipline in the care and education of children. These ideals continue to evoke admiration by many who have found them key to not only raising healthy, happy children but also to stemming the tide of violence in our schools and society. Others dismiss these same principles for being idealistic at best and harmful at worst. </p><p>In this wonderful account, Bill Ayers speaks as a parent and an educator who has spent years in the classroom experimenting with Neill&#x2019;s progressive approach. While Ayers admits to being a long-time fan of Neill&#x2019;s, he also admits that Neill&#x2019;s techniques sometimes &#x201c;seemed more than a little loony&#x201d; when they first appeared. It is Ayers&#x2019; honest, straightforward approach that makes his treatment of Neill so valuable and relevant to how we treat and raise our children today. </p><p>This vital and unique volume is a great read for parents, teachers, and anyone considering alternative visions for raising children and overcoming violence in today&#x2019;s society.

Lippmann dubbed this manipulative opinion-making process "the manufacture of consent." A more familiar term for such large-scale persuasion would be propaganda. In <i>Weapons of Democracy,</i> Jonathan Auerbach explores how Lippmann&#x2019;s stark critique gave voice to a set of misgivings that had troubled American social reformers since the late nineteenth century.</p><p>Progressives, social scientists, and muckrakers initially drew on mass persuasion as part of the effort to mobilize sentiment for their own cherished reforms, including regulating monopolies, protecting consumers, and promoting disinterested, efficient government. "Propaganda" was associated with public education and consciousness raising for the good of the whole. By the second decade of the twentieth century, the need to muster support for American involvement in the Great War produced the Committee on Public Information, which zealously spread the gospel of American democracy abroad and worked to stifle dissent at home. After the war, public relations firms&#x2015;which treated publicity as an end in itself&#x2015;proliferated.</p><p><i>Weapons of Democracy</i> traces the fate of American public opinion in theory and practice from 1884 to 1934 and explains how propaganda continues to shape today&#x2019;s public sphere. The book closely analyzes the work of prominent political leaders, journalists, intellectuals, novelists, and corporate publicists, including Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain, George Creel, John Dewey, Julia Lathrop, Ivy Lee, and Edward Bernays. Truly interdisciplinary in both scope and method, this book will appeal to students and scholars in American studies, history, political theory, media and communications, and rhetoric and literary studies.</p></p><p><p>How and why did public opinion&#x2015;long cherished as a foundation of democratic government&#x2015;become an increasing source of concern for American Progressives?</p><p><b>Jonathan Auerbach</b> is a professor of English at the University of Maryland&#x2013;College Park.

SCHLESINGER, JR., the author of sixteen books, was a renowned historian and social critic. He twice won the Pulitzer Prize, in 1946 for The Age of Jackson and in 1966 for A Thousand Days. He was also the winner of the National Book Award for both A Thousand Days and Robert Kennedy and His Times (1979). In 1998 he was awarded the prestigious National Humanities Medal.Schlesinger, a wide-ranging historian and political activist, considers topics such as the Cold War, political parties, the presidency, and many broader philosophical issues. Never one to soft-peddle his opinions, Schlesinger confronts scholars and politicians on the left and right who, he believes, bend history to their own ideological ends. Much of what appears in these essays has been published in various articles over the past generation during which the author was a leading proponent of a centrist approach to politics and foreign policy. To his credit, Schlesinger makes clear that his perspective has been altered somewhat by the passing years.

Not only is the book filled with superb and memorable images, but there is also practically no text to encounter while viewing this mini museum disguised as a book. There are few who can compare their body of work to this artist. (Jeffrey Felner <i>New York Journal of Books</i>)<br><br>Patrick Demarchelier is a prolific, award-winning modern photographer who since the mid-1970s has worked for almost every major fashion publication, including Vogue, Vanity Fair, Harper&#x2019;s BAZAAR, Allure and Glamour. This new monograph collects over 400 of his most referential images from that period of time. Originally published to be available for his exhibition at the Petit Palais in Paris, entitled &#x201c;Patrick Demarchelier: Images et Mode � Paris,&#x201d; this book is thick with both imagery as well as artistic inspiration. The works range from commercial print editorial to private portraits, and although extremely proficient in the use of color, Demarchelier truly excels in the arena of black-and-white monochromatic photographs.

In this book Nietzsche was laying the groundwork for a fundamental philosophical and political revolution on a global scale. One of the difficulties that the text poses is Nietzsche&#39;s prophetic style; Stanley Rosen unweaves the complex threads that form the rhetorical voices of the work, and so explains the style in an accessible manner. He rejects recent sceptical, deconstructionist interpretations of Nietzsche, and reveals a coherence underlying the multiple and apparently incompatible intentions embedded in the text. Nietzsche is a figure whose influence on contemporary thought in the humanities and social sciences continues to be enormous. This book is sure to become the definitive study of Zarathustra, and will have a broad appeal to philosophers and students of modern philosophy, intellectual historians, political scientists, and literary theorists.</p><p>The Mask of Enlightenment is the most detailed textual and thematic study of Nietzsche&#39;sThus Spake Zarathustra.

Such knowledge is needed in the biochemical, chemical, energy, fermentation, materials, mining, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, polymer, and waste-processing industries. Written from a chemical engineering perspective, this comprehensive text covers fluid mechanics first from a macroscopic then a microscopic perspective. Fluid Mechanics for Chemical Engineers gives the undergraduate and first-year graduate student a comprehensive overview of this essential topic. Bridging the gap between the physicist and the practitioner, the book provides numerous real-world examples and problems of increasing detail and complexity, including several from the University of Cambridge chemical engineering examinations. It also covers all the material necessary to pass the fluid mechanics portion of the Professional Engineer&#39;s exam.</p><p>Preface <br> <br> This text has evolved from a need for a single volume that embraces a wide range of topics in fluid mechanics. The material consists of two parts &#x2014; four chapters on macroscopic or relatively large-scale phenomena, followed by eight chapters on microscopic or relatively small-scale phenomena. <br> <br> Throughout, we have tried to keep in mind topics of industrial importance to the chemical engineer. <br> <br> Part I&#x2014;Macroscopic fluid mechanics. Chapter 1 is concerned with basic fluid concepts and definitions, and also a discussion of hydrostatics. Chapter 2 covers the three basic rate laws, in the form of mass, energy, and momentum balances. Chapters 3 and 4 deal with fluid flow through pipes and other types of chemical engineering equipment, respectively. <br> <br> Part II&#x2014;Microscopic fluid mechanics. Chapter 5 is concerned with the fundamental operations of vector analysis and the development of the basic differential equations that govern fluid flow in general. Chapter 6 presents several examples that show how these basic equations can be solved to give solutions to representative problems in which viscosity is important, including polymer-processing, in rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. Chapter 7 treats the broad class of inviscid flow problems known as irrotational flows; the theory also applies to flow in porous media, of importance in petroleum production and the underground storage of natural gas. Chapter 8 analyzes two-dimensional flows in which there is a preferred orientation to the velocity, which occurs in situations such as boundary layers, lubrication, calendering, and thin films. Turbulence and analogies between momentum and energy transport are treated in Chapter 9. Bubble motion, two-phase flow in horizontal and vertical pipes, and fluidization &#x2014; including the motion of bubbles in fluidized beds &#x2014; are discussed in Chapter 10. Chapter 11 introduces the concept of non-Newtonian fluids. Finally, Chapter 12 discusses the Matlab PDE Toolbox as an instrument for the numerical solution of problems in fluid mechanics. <br> <br> In our experience, an undergraduate fluid mechanics course can be based on Part I plus selected parts of Part II. And a graduate course can be based on essentially the whole of Part II, supplemented perhaps by additional material on topics such as approximate methods, stability, and computational fluid mechanics. <br> <br> There is an average of about five completely worked examples in each chapter. The numerous end-of-chapter problems have been classified roughly as easy (E), moderate (M), or difficult (D). Also, the University of Cambridge has very kindly given permission &#x2014; graciously endorsed by Prof. J.F. Davidson, F.R.S. &#x2014; for several of their chemical engineering examination problems to be reproduced in original or modified form, and these have been given the additional designation of &#x201c;(C).&#x201d; <br> <br> The website engin.umich/~fmche is maintained as a &#x201c; bulletin board&#x201d; for giving additional information about Fluid Mechanics for Chemical Engineers &#x2014; hints for problem solutions, errata, how to contact the authors, etc. &#x2014; as proves desirable. <br> <br> I gratefully acknowledge the contributions of my colleague Stacy Bike, who has not only made many constructive suggestions for improvements, but has also written the chapter on non-Newtonian fluids. I very much appreciate the assistance of several other friends and colleagues, including Nitin Anturkar, Brice Carnahan, Kevin Ellwood, Scott Fogler, Lisa Keyser, Kartic Khilar, Ronald Larson, Donald Nicklin, Margaret Sansom, Michael Solomon, Sandra Swisher, Rasin Tek, and my wife Mary Ann Gibson Wilkes. Also very helpful were Joanne Anzalone, Barbara Cotton, Bernard Goodwin, Robert Weisman and the staff at Prentice Hall, and the many students who have taken my courses.

Returning to Cambridge, he taught engineering from 1937&#x2014;1946 before being selected to lead the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Cambridge during its formative years after the end of World War II. As a scholar and a gentleman, Fox was a shy but exceptionally brilliant person who had great insight into what was important and who quickly brought the department to a preeminent position. He succeeded in combining an industrial perspective with intellectual rigor. Fox relinquished the leadership of the department in 1959, after he had secured a permanent new building for it (carefully designed in part by himself) before his untimely death in 1964. <br> <br> Fox was instrumental in bringing Kenneth Denbigh, John Davidson, Peter Danckwerts and others into the department. Danckwerts subsequently wrote an appreciation (P.V. Danckwerts, &#x201c;Chemical Engineering Comes to Cambridge,&#x201d; The Cambridge Review, pp. 53&#x2014;55, 28 February 1983) of Fox's talents, saying, with almost complete accuracy: &#x201c;Fox instigated no research and published nothing.&#x201d; How times have changed &#x2014; today, unless he were known personally, his resume would probably be cast aside and he would stand little chance of being hired, let alone of receiving tenure! However, his lectures, meticulously written handouts, enthusiasm, genius, and friendship were a great inspiration to me, and I have much pleasure in acknowledging his impact on my career. <br> <br> James O.

Buried within the heart of this incredible vision of shapes and colors lie hundreds of monasteries and churches where Christian communities lived and prayed for the greater part of two millennia.<br> This comprehensive study explores the land and hidden monuments of Christian Cappadocia. Spiro Kostof has written a readable, general introduction to the rockcut architecture of Cappadocia and its painted decoration and a critical review of the current state of scholarship on the subject. Focusing on the physical setting, the buildings, and painting programs in the context of their creation, he discusses the nature and historical background of monasticism in Cappadocia; depicts the builders, artists, and patrons who created the monuments; and describes the sources and meaning of the particular types of buildings and painting programs. This detailed account of the region and its monuments also includes revealing line drawings of plans, elevations, and cross sections, a glossary of terms, notes, a bibliography, and an index, as well as a new introduction for this edition.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Spiro Kostof</strong> is Professor of Architectural History at the University of California, Berkeley.

This anomalous ecology mutated into a femicide machine: an apparatus that didn't just create the conditions for the murders of dozens of women and little girls, but developed the institutions that guarantee impunity for those crimes and even legalize them. A lawless city sponsored by a State in crisis. The facts speak for themselves.<br>&#x2015;from <i>The Femicide Machine</i></p><p>Best known to American readers for his cameo appearances as The Journalist in Roberto Bolano's <i>2666</i> and as a literary detective in Javier Mar�as's nove<i>l Dark Back of Time</i>, Sergio Gonz�lez Rodr�guez is one of Mexico's most important contemporary writers. He is the author of <i>Bones in the Desert</i>, the most definitive work on the murders of women and girls in Ju�rez, Mexico, as well as <i>The Headless Man</i>, a sharp meditation on the recurrent uses of symbolic violence; <i>Infectious</i>, a novel; and <i>Original Evil,</i> a long essay.

Recognized in ancient times as one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the legendary Hanging Garden of Babylon and its location have long been steeped in mystery and puzzling myths. <br><br>In this remarkable volume Stephanie Dalley, a world expert on ancient Babylonian language, exposes new evidence and clarifies all the known material about this enigmatic World Wonder. Placing the Garden within a tradition of royal patronage, Dalley describes how the decipherment of an original text and its link to sculpture in the British Museum has enabled her to pin down where and by which king the Garden was laid out, and to describe in detail what it looked like. Through this dramatic and fascinating reconstruction of the Garden, Dalley also follows its influence on later garden design. <br><br>Unscrambling layer by layer the many stories that have built up around the Garden, including the parts played by Semiramis and Nebuchadnezzar, Dalley shows why this Garden deserves its place alongside the Pyramids and the Colossus of Rhodes as one of the most astonishing technical achievements of the ancient world.</p><p><br><strong>Stephanie Dalley</strong> is an Honorary Research Fellow at Somerville College, Oxford, a Member of Wolfson College, Oxford, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. With degrees in Assyriology from the Universities of Cambridge and London, her academic career has specialized in the study of ancient cuneiform texts and she has worked on archaeological excavations in Iraq, Turkey, Syria, and Jordan. She has written several books on the myths and culture of ancient Mesopotamia, with special reference to their impact on later civilizations, many of which have been translated into Arabic, Italian, and Japanese.

The text traces Morandi's many influences, from Giotto to Cezanne and the Metaphysical painters to the Cubists, and discusses the manner in which his life and work have informed the critical interpretations of his art. A wealth of color reproductions illustrates every phase of Morandi's career, including his signature still lifes and landscapes with their serene groupings of muted objects.<br></p><p>Few major twentieth-century artists seem duller at first glance than Morandi (1890^-1964). Except for some very early portraits, his work is "about" just three things: the landscape, with windowless houses, of hilly northern Italy; the courtyard of Morandi's apartment building in Bologna; and bottles, bowls, boxes, and other utensils atop a table. His palette of dusty hues is more subdued than that of the cubists, he regards his subjects from directly in front of them, and, except in the paintings from the year he was influenced by Di Chirico, he eschews dramatic effects. Those who know painting, however, see Morandi as the greatest disciple of Ce zanne and a painter whose subject is seeing itself and who, in the acts of seeing and representing, teases out meaning and feeling. Wilkin, one of the best contemporary writers on art, helps us realize Morandi's relationship to Ce zanne and also to the much earlier Giotto and Piero della Francesca brilliantly well.

This interpretation holds that subsequent removal of deposits from the Bank led to unsound credit expansion and inflation, to unprecedented speculation in public land, to the Panic of 1837, and ultimately to the depression.</p><p>"Not true," write Professor Temin in this thoroughly researched and documented study which shatters the traditional interpretation of the 1830's. "Jackson's economic policies undoubtedly were not the most enlightened the country has ever seen, but they were by no means disastrous. The inflation and crisis of the 1930's had their origin in events largely beyond Jackson's control and probably would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did.

This claim establishes him as the founder of the idealist tradition in philosophy. The text printed in this volume is the 1734 edition of the <em>Principles</em>, which represents Berkeley's mature thought. Also included are four important letters between George Berkeley and Samuel Johnson, written between 1729 and 1730, an analysis of the <em>Principles</em>, and a glossary.<br></p><p>Jonathan Dancy is at University of Reading.</p><h2>Cinco maestros: Cuentos modernos de Hispanoam�rica (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>The five outstanding authors in this anthology have created remarkably distinctive worlds of their own, worlds that are well reflected in the stories included here. The stories representing each author might be said to function like a mobile: considered separately, they are unique and interesting pieces of art, while together they form a recognizable pattern and give an impression of the author&#39;s imaginative world. The anthology as a whole then becomes a collection of such literary mobiles, a vivid exhibition that testifies to the high level of brilliance achieved by contemporary Spanish-American fiction. CINCO MAESTROS is designed for use in the third semester of study and beyond. The stories in this anthology are made more readily accessible to students by the addition of notes and vocabulary.</p><p></p><h2>Mother Courage and Her Children (Student Editions)</h2><p><p>This Student Edition of Brecht's anti-war masterpiece features an extensive<br>introduction and commentary that includes a plot summary, discussion of<br>the context, themes, characters, style and language as well as<br>questions for further study and notes on words and phrases in the text.<br>It is the perfect edition for students of theatre and literature.<br>In this chronicle of the Thirty Years War of the seventeenth century, Mother Courage follows the armies back and forth across Europe, selling provisions and liquor from her canteen wagon. As the action of the play progresses between the years 1624 and 1646 she loses her children to the war but remains indomitable, refusing to part with her livelihood - the wagon. The play is one of the most celebrated examples of Epic Theatre and of Brecht's use of alienation effect to focus attention on the issues of the play above the individual characters. It remains regarded as one of the greatest plays of the twentieth century and one of the great anti-war plays of all time. The Berlin production of 1949, with Helene Weigel as Mother Courage, marked the foundation of the Berliner Ensemble. </p><p>This volume contains expert notes on the author's life and work, historical and political background to the play, photographs from stage productions and a glossary of difficult words and phrases. The play is translated by Brecht scholar John Willett who did more than anyone else to make Brecht's work available in the English language.</p></p><p>One of Brecht&#39;s most famous plays and a classic of modern literature/theatre, this Student Edition features a comprehensive introduction, commentary and study aids besides the full text of the play.A major dramatist of the twentieth century, Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) was the founder of one of the most influential theatre companies, the Berliner Ensemble, and the creator of some of the landmark plays of the twentieth century: <i>The Threepenny Opera</i>, <i>Life of Galileo</i>, <i>Mother Courage</i> and <i>The Caucasian Chalk Circle. </i>His plays and dramatic theory are central to the study of modern theatre.</p><h2>Nutrition: From Science to You (3rd Edition)</h2><p><b>NOTE: You are purchasing a standalone product; </b> <b> <b>MasteringNutrition </b>does not come packaged with this content.

He not only revisits this urban conglomeration, but also seeks out previously unheard groups such as women and blacks. The result is a more rounded portrait of a small eastern city on the verge of becoming modern.</p><p>Alan Dawley is Professor of History, The College of New Jersey.At a time when global forces often seem more important than any particular place, this classic study of America's industrial revolution reminds us that the local community can sometimes provide the most revealing setting for understanding larger social processes.

First published in 1976, Dawley's book was widely influential as a model case study, as an application of class analysis to American social history, and as an example of social history with the politics left in.

This edition is specifically tailored to engage and educate young readers with some of the greatest works ever written, while still thrilling older readers who have loving memories of this series of old.</p><p>Set in 1885, The Ox-Bow Incident is a searing and realistic portrait of frontier life and mob violence in the American West. First published in 1940, it focuses on the lynching of three innocent men and the tragedy that ensues when law and order are abandoned. The result is an emotionally powerful, vivid, and unforgettable re-creation of the Western novel, which Clark transmuted into a universal story about good and evil, individual and community, justice and human nature. As Wallace Stegner writes, [Clark's] theme was civilization, and he recorded, indelibly, its first steps in a new country. <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p>Walter Van Tilburg Clark (3 August 1909 &#x2015; 10 November 1971) was an American author notable for writing "The Ox-Bow Incident".<br><br>NORMAN NODEL (Nochem Yeshaya) was a noted artist and illustrator of children's books and magazines.

Taken by amateur photographers with simple point-and-shoot cameras, snapshots often commemorate something that is private and personal; yet they also reflect widely held cultural conventions. The poses may be formulaic, but a photograph of loved ones can evoke a deep affective response. In <i>Snapshot Photography</i>, Catherine Zuromskis examines the development of a form of visual expression that is both public and private. </p><p>Scholars of art and culture tend to discount snapshot photography; it is too ubiquitous, too unremarkable, too personal. Zuromskis argues for its significance. Snapshot photographers, she contends, are not so much creating spontaneous records of their lives as they are participating in a prescriptive cultural ritual. A snapshot is not only a record of interpersonal intimacy but also a means of linking private symbols of domestic harmony to public ideas of social conformity. </p><p>Through a series of case studies, Zuromskis explores the social life of snapshot photography in the United States in the latter half of the twentieth century. She examines the treatment of snapshot photography in the 2002 film <i>One Hour Photo</i> and in the television crime drama <i>Law and Order: Special Victims Unit</i>; the growing interest of collectors and museum curators in &#x201c;vintage&#x201d; snapshots; and the &#x201c;snapshot aesthetic&#x201d; of Andy Warhol and Nan Goldin. She finds that Warhol's photographs of the Factory community and Goldin's intense and intimate photographs of friends and family use the conventions of the snapshot to celebrate an alternate version of &#x201c;family values.&#x201d; </p><p>In today's digital age, snapshot photography has become even more ubiquitous and ephemeral&#x2015;and, significantly, more public. But buried within snapshot photography's mythic construction, Zuromskis argues, is a site of democratic possibility. </p></p><p>Catherine Zuromskis is Assistant Professor in the Department of Art and Art History at the University of New Mexico.<p>Contesting the will-to-conformity we tend to associate with snapshots, <i>Snapshot Photography</i> sees at least some of them as creating new modes of social belonging, and thus of social being. In the process of giving the snapshot a provocative social agency, Catherine Zuromskis also helps to restore this ubiquitous genre of photography to its own complicated history.</p>&#x2015;<b>Geoffrey Batchen</b>, Victoria University of Wellington; and editor, <i>Photography Degree Zero</i><br><br><p>As snapshot images have become objects of cultural nostalgia in the digital age, this book offers rich insights into their manifold social and communal practices and their surprising aesthetic influence.

Gary Davis</h2><p>Who was the greatest of all American guitarists? You probably didn&#x2019;t name Gary Davis, but many of his musical contemporaries considered him without peer. Bob Dylan called Davis &#x201c;one of the wizards of modern music.&#x201d; Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead&#x2014;who took lessons with Davis&#x2014;claimed his musical ability &#x201c;transcended any common notion of a bluesman.&#x201d; And the folklorist Alan Lomax called him &#x201c;one of the really great geniuses of American instrumental music.&#x201d; But you won&#x2019;t find Davis alongside blues legends Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Despite almost universal renown among his contemporaries, Davis lives today not so much in his own work but through covers of his songs by Dylan, Jackson Browne, and many others, as well as in the untold number of students whose lives he influenced.<br><br> The first biography of Davis, <i>Say No to the Devil </i>restores &#x201c;the Rev&#x2019;s&#x201d; remarkable story. Drawing on extensive research and interviews with many of Davis&#x2019;s former students, Ian Zack takes readers through Davis&#x2019;s difficult beginning as the blind son of sharecroppers in the Jim Crow South to his decision to become an ordained Baptist minister and his move to New York in the early 1940s, where he scraped out a living singing and preaching on street corners and in storefront churches in Harlem. There, he gained entry into a circle of musicians that included, among many others, Lead Belly, Woody Guthrie, and Dave Van Ronk. But in spite of his tremendous musical achievements, Davis never gained broad recognition from an American public that wasn&#x2019;t sure what to make of his trademark blend of gospel, ragtime, street preaching, and the blues. His personal life was also fraught, troubled by struggles with alcohol, women, and deteriorating health.<br><br> Zack chronicles this remarkable figure in American music, helping us to understand how he taught and influenced a generation of musicians.</p><p><b>Ian Zack</b> is a New York&#x2013;based journalist whose work has appeared in the <i>New York Times, Forbes,</i> and <i>Acoustic Guitar</i>.

Gary Davis is that blind man you brushed by on your way to the stadium to see the big act perform. Zack's brilliant account compels us to pause for a long look at an artist who was always there, even if we didn't see him." (<i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2015-05-11)<br><br>&#x201c;Zack has plumbed the depths of this fascinating, complex character . . . to cover the long career of a blind bluesman who honed his trade at rent parties, chitlin&#x2019;-circuit dives, and hootnanies, influencing a generation of folk and blues guitarists. . . . For those unfamiliar with this blues great, or folk-blues buffs ready to immerse themselves once again in his legend, <i>Say No to the Devil</i> is a tuneful read.&#x201d; (<i>Acoustic Guitar</i> 2015-04-06)<br><br>"Finally, the biography that Rev. Davis deserves. Ian Zack takes 'Blind Gary' out of the footnotes and into the footlights of the history of American music. Like John Coltrane, George Gershwin, Jimi Hendrix, and the rest of the very few, Davis&#x2019;s genius was unique and uncompromising. How he was able to take gospel and blues and create a style that was so unique and so powerful is a story that had to be told. Now, thanks to Zack&#x2019;s careful research and unbounded respect for his subject, we finally have insight into the art and environment that was Davis&#x2019;s life story. With this biography, Davis can finally take his place in the pantheon of the greatest of American musicians." (Steve Katz, cofounder of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears)<br><br>"This isn&#x2019;t a dry who-did-what-when kind of biography. It&#x2019;s like Zack followed [Davis] around, making note of the boy teaching himself to play the guitar, to the confident blues performer who could play on any stage.

A must-read for anyone interested in the blues, the folk revival, or the life of a true American genius."

Starting from the principle that human behavior is goal oriented and socially embedded, Adlerian therapy is a brief psychoeducational approach that emphasizes understanding individuals&#39; characteristic ways of moving through life - the life style - before working toward change. The authors demonstrate the relevance of Adlerian therapy today by illustrating how Adler&#39;s ideas have influenced current practice and emphasizing the short-term nature of its interventions. In addition, the authors show how Adlerian therapy works in practice with individuals, couples, families, and groups, as well as in educational settings. This book is for practitioners of all orientations who want to ground their practices in a holistic theory that makes sense for today&#39;s world. Students will also benefit from learning about Adler&#39;s theory and flexible strategies.</p><p></p><h2>Laboratory Manual for Hole's Essentials of A&amp;P</h2><p>This full-color manual is designed for students with minimal backgrounds in science who are pursuing careers in allied health fields.

Searching for those whose weirdness expresses itself through art, sport, religion, and other relatively normal pursuits, writers Susan Sheehan and Howard Means found 40 strangely compelling stories, recounted in the wonderfully titled <i>The Banana Sculptor, the Purple Lady, and the All-Night Swimmer</i>. One man's ambition is to eat at every McDonald's in the United States; a young woman has won more than 3,000 ribbons at the huge Iowa State Fair. The authors go beyond simple believe-it-or-not reporting, instead interviewing each of their subjects to tease out their motivations and the consequences of their passions. One gentleman, whose aim is to swim across each of the Great Lakes, admits that his goals don't permit him to have a family or much social interaction, but he seems genuinely satisfied with his purpose in life. Much of the book is told in the subjects' own words, which offer insights into the pride and humility, the genius and madness of these singular individuals. The book may not inspire the kind of zeal it takes to carve a life-sized <i>Last Supper</i>, but it will help readers appreciate the weirdness to be found in ordinary people. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Susan Sheehan</b> is the author of seven books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Is There No Place on Earth for Me?</i> She has been a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> since 1961 and has written for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Architectural Digest,</i> where she is a contributing writer.

In his prose introduction, mother and motherland are strangely, strongly linked, and Ali, who has made a career of lyric ponderings of the permutations of exile and expatriate life, is left to negotiate the landscape of loss, its contours altered by the intrusion of the intensely personal. Ali has always been the one "with laments found lost on my lips," the post-colonial poet mourning dead aspects of his native culture while championing the complexity of his tripartite heritage. In The Country Without a Post Office, these themes were galvanized by the eruption of internecine war in Indian-held Kashmir, and by Ali's adoption of the tightly repetitive, traditional Arabic form of the ghazal. This latest volume balances formal elegy with a deliberate refusal to "finish rooms," figured perhaps most poignantly by the refusal to complete the well-known religious truism "There is no God but" and with more intellectualized musings on homecoming, heritage and the ravages of civil war. In this context, the repetitive ghazal replicates the keening of a mourning relative and the structure offered by tradition, while its line-by-line changes mark a way out of the repetitive cycles of historical violence. "Exiled by exiles" gives way to "two destinies at last reconciled by exiles." Ali's attempts to reconcile his Muslim, Hindu and Western heritage (which draws on James Merrill's mysticism) andn to quiet his cries of anguish, work to assuage grief without denying that "the loved one always leaves." The book has been nominated as a National Book Award finalist. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Magic For Dummies</h2><p>You don&#x2019;t need a white tiger, expensive props, or hours of preparation to do magic.

Through her conception of the beauty salon as a place of modernist display, she empowered the modern woman to define herself through her choices in taste and decor.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Helena Rubinstein: Beauty Is Power</i> traces the path of this remarkable early feminist and visionary art patron. In Rubinstein&#x2019;s world, art and commerce blended seamlessly. She ornamented her salons and homes with splendid artworks&#x2014;Surrealist murals, modernist portraits, Art Deco furniture, Venetian mirrors, and one of the era&#x2019;s great collections of African and Oceanic art. Her understanding of beauty was similarly expansive and democratic: she saw the face as the site for self-expression and the exploration of identity.&nbsp;The Rubinstein beauty program thus included not only makeup and hairdressing, but also lessons in health, deportment, and culture. Such features, innovative at the time and wildly popular, today provide a fascinating glimpse into popular culture as it affected women in the 20th century.<br> &nbsp;<br></p><p>This fascinating book traces the path of the great 20th-century cosmetics entrepreneur&nbsp;Helena Rubinstein, a&nbsp;remarkable early feminist and visionary art patron.<b>Mason Klein</b> is a curator at the Jewish Museum, New York.&nbsp;</p><h2>Welding for Collision Repair</h2><p>This exciting new book isolates the important skills of welding in today&#39;s collision market.

It not only involved these titans but also the rest of the globe; many proxy wars were fought much to the detriment of the developing world. In a clear, concise manner, this book explains how the Cold War originated and developed between 1941 and 1949. </p> <p>The fourth edition is revised, updated and expanded to include new material on topics such as the culture wars and Stalin&#x2019;s view of Marxism. The introduction looks at the various approaches which have been adopted to analyse the Cold War and the challenges to arrive at a theory which can explain it. The book explores questions such as: </p> <p>- Who was responsible for the Cold War? </p> <p>- Was it inevitable or could it have been avoided? </p> <p>- Was Stalin genuinely interested in a post-war agreement? </p> <p>Illustrated with maps and figures and containing a chronology and who&#x2019;s who of key individuals, <em>Origins of the Cold War 1941-1949</em> incorporates the most recent scholarship, theories and information to provide students with an invaluable introduction to a fascinating period that shaped today's world.</p></p><p><p>Martin McCauley is a prolific author and broadcaster who has a wealth of experience in Soviet, Russian and international affairs.

Scott Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896, attended Princeton University, and published his first novel, This Side of Paradise, in 1920. That same year he married Zelda Sayre and the couple divided their time among New York, Paris, and the Riviera, becoming a part of the American expatriate circle that included Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and John Dos Passos. Fitzgerald was a major new literary voice, and his masterpieces include The Beautiful and Damned, The Great Gatsby, and Tender Is the Night. He died of a heart attack in 1940 at the age of forty-four, while working on The Love of the Last Tycoon. For his sharp social insight and breathtaking lyricism, Fitzgerald is known as one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Unexpected Miracles: The Gift of Synchronicity and How to Open it</h2><p>Filled with stories and examples, and combining insights from psychology, religion and poetry.</p><p>It was Carl Jung who, with quantum physicist Wolfgang Pauli, coined the term <i>synchronicity</i> to describe apparent coincidences that are dramatically, often deeply meaningful. The better part of a century has passed since then, but synchronicity is now (synchronistically?) attaining its 15 minutes of fame, with a spate of recent books on the subject. Richo's is among the best, highly erudite and scholarly but charmingly enthusiastic and full of intriguing narratives. Because synchronicity favors the prepared mind, psychotherapist Richo offers a series of exercises for eliciting and then understanding how to learn from synchonistic occurrences. Dreams, omens, fleeting but repetitive images--all these can hold clues to life's unfolding. Richo takes a remarkably commonsensical approach to a relatively esoteric subject, demystifying synchronicity without making it any less magical. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i></p><h2>Oneness: Great Principles Shared by All Religions</h2><p>"An impressive array of selections. They show common ethics that transcend the narrow confines of sectarianism."<br>ATLANTA JOURNAL &amp; CONSTITUTION<br>Beneath the seeming differences of all the world's great religions, lies a pool of universal truth. ONENESS collects these beliefs together for the first time, in the actual words of each religion's scriptures. These universal principles act as a guide to inner development, and allow each individual to achieve spiritual richness.</p><p>Author's note: The most recent edition of <i>Oneness</i>, published in 2002 in softcover and 2007 in the Kindle edition, contains more than twice as many principles and sayings as previous editions. Also, the recent edition is fully annotated, providing the source of each scriptural saying in the book. Many readers and reviewers have been asking for this.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Library Review article on this page, which mentions the lack of annotations, pertains to one of the earliest editions of <i>Oneness</i>, published in 1989-90.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the reviews of <i>Oneness</i> above, you'll notice a comment made by Mother Teresa about the book. In a private conversation between us, she said: "I pray that this book accomplishes what God wants it to." While this may sound a bit vague, what she meant by this, she explained, is that God has a special purpose for every action. People's individual desires and egos, however, often distort this. Her prayer meant that she hoped people would not thwart or alter God's intention for the message of <i>Oneness</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> This book was written simply, not to argue that all religions are the same, but to show that the great scriptural principles we all associate with spirituality are expressed very similarly--and in some cases almost word-for-word--in all religions. The book was designed so a simple glance at any of the pages would give the message that the underlying similarities of the world's religions are unifying. They have the overwhelming effect of creating "Oneness," in which differences dissolve and the soul can wonder, Why do we have such conflicts?&#x201c;As this book shows . . . every major religion of the world has similar ideas of love [and] the same goal of benefiting humanity through spiritual practice.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;The Dalai Lama<br><br>&#x201c;An impressive array of selections.

Her main concern is not the buildings themselves, but rather the dynamic character of Christianity and how church buildings shape and influence the religion. Kilde argues that a primary function of church buildings is to represent and reify three different types of power: divine power, or ideas about God; personal empowerment as manifested in the individual's perceived relationship to the divine; and social power, meaning the relationships between groups such as clergy and laity. Each type intersects with notions of Christian creed, cult, and code, and is represented spatially and materially in church buildings.<br><br>Kilde explores these categories chronologically, from the early church to the twentieth century. She considers the form, organization, and use of worship rooms; the location of churches; and the interaction between churches and the wider culture.<br> <br>Church buildings have been integral to Christianity, and Kilde's important study sheds new light on the way they impact all aspects of the religion. Neither mere witnesses to transformations of religious thought or nor simple backgrounds for religious practice, church buildings are, in Kilde's view, dynamic participants in religious change and goldmines of information on Christianity itself.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jeanne Halgren Kilde</strong> is the author of <em>When Church Became Theatre: The Transformation of Evangelical Architecture and Worship in Nineteenth-Century America</em>.

Her works are careful, imaginative, and daring, and this treatment of the linkages of power and space is brilliant. The book's depth and reach are breathtaking, and its implications are manifold." --Calvin J. Roetzel, Sundet Professor of New Testament and Christian Studies, University of Minnesota<p></p><br>"Kilde's book is one that has long been needed. It provides a concise introduction to the periods of church-building, enlivened by a clearly articulated point of view. It is focused on a selection of important churches. And it is informed by an interpretive grid that readers will find tremendously useful as a starting point for analysis and discussion.

The cofounder of the Stanford Literary Lab, he brought quantitative methods into the study of the novel, enabling a &#x201c;distant&#x201d; reading that uses computation to analyze literary production over centuries. But at the same time, he was also teaching undergraduates the history of literature. Knowing Moretti, it&#x2019;s no surprise that he didn&#x2019;t teach the course the accepted way: one author after another, in a long uninterrupted chain. Instead, he put an irregular chessboard in front of his students that was too strange to be taken for granted.

Highly acclaimed and commercially successful, over the years their movies have attracted increasingly larger audiences and spawned a subculture of dedicated fans. Shunning fame and celebrity, Ethan and Joel Coen remain maverick filmmakers, producing and directing independent films outside the Hollywood mainstream in a unique style combining classic genres like film noir with black comedy to tell off-beat stories about America and the American Dream. This study surveys Oscar-winning films, such as <i>Fargo</i> (1996) and <i>No Country for Old Men</i> (2007), as well as cult favorites, including <i>O Brother, Where Art Thou? </i>(2000) and <i>The Big Lebowski</i> (1998). Beginning with <i>Blood Simple</i> (1984), it examines major themes and generic constructs and offers diverse approaches to the Coens' enigmatic films. Pointing to the pulp fiction of Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, and Raymond Chandler, the study appreciates the postmodern aesthetics of the Coens' intertextual creativity.</p><p>Jeffrey Adams is associate professor at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro.

Levchenko is an ex-KGB operative in the US. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>The subtitle of this book is somewhat misleading. Romerstein, a U.S. government specialist on Soviet espionage, and Levchenko, a former KGB officer, devote most of their chronicle to the history of the Kremlin's intelligence efforts against the United States since the 1920s and comparatively little to the "how" of current operations. Names, dates, aliases, descriptions of meetings, and allegations appear in overwhelming profusion but with little benefit of summary or analysis. Most librarians can rely on Richard Deacon's A History of the Russian Secret Service ( LJ 8/72; o.p.) for historical coverage and can choose from a variety of more readable descriptions of current KGB practice, such as John Barron's KGB Today (Reader's Digest Pr., 1983) and Jay Tuck's High-Tech Espionage ( LJ 8/86).<br><i>- James R.

Now with a new afterword by Bryan Caplan, this explosive book argues that the primary function of education is not to enhance students' skills but to signal the qualities of a good employee. Learn why students hunt for easy As only to forget most of what they learn after the final exam, why decades of growing access to education have not resulted in better jobs for average workers, how employers reward workers for costly schooling they rarely ever use, and why cutting education spending is the best remedy. Romantic notions about education being "good for the soul" must yield to careful research and common sense&#x2015;<i>The Case against Education</i> points the way.</p></p><p><b>Why we need to stop wasting public funds on education</b><p> "Few would disagree that our education system needs reform. While most call for more--more government subsidies, more time in school, more students attending college--Caplan provocatively argues for less. <i>The Case against Education</i> urges a radical rethinking about why we've been unsuccessful to date--and why more of the same won't work."<b>--Vicki Alger, Independent Institute</b></p><p> "Bryan Caplan has written what is sure to be one of the most intriguing and provocative books on education published this year. His boldly contrarian conclusion--that much schooling and public support for education is astonishingly wasteful, if not counterproductive--is compelling enough that it should be cause for serious reflection on the part of parents, students, educators, advocates, and policymakers."<b>--Frederick Hess, American Enterprise Institute</b></p><p> "You doubtless asked many times in school, 'When am I going to use this?' Bryan Caplan asks the same question, about everything taught prekindergarten through graduate school, and has a disturbing answer: almost never. Indeed, we'd be better off with a lot less education. It's heresy that must be heard."<b>--Neal McCluskey, Cato Institute</b></p><p> "<i>The Case against Education</i> is a riveting book. Bryan Caplan, the foremost whistle-blower in the academy, argues persuasively that learning about completely arbitrary subjects is attractive to employers because it signals students' intelligence, work ethic, desire to please, and conformity--even when such learning conveys no cognitive advantage or increase in human capital."<b>--Stephen J.

Now, in <em>William Randolph Hearst</em>, Ben Procter gives us the most authoritative account of Hearst's extraordinary career in newspapers and politics.<br> Born to great wealth--his father was a partial owner of four fabulously rich mines--Hearst began his career in his early twenties by revitalizing a rundown newspaper, the <em>San Franciso Examiner</em>. Hearst took what had been a relatively sedate form of communicating information and essentially created the modern tabloid, complete with outrageous headlines, human interest stories, star columnists, comic strips, wide photo coverage, and crusading zeal. His papers fairly bristled with life. By 1910 he had built a newspaper empire--eight papers and two magazines read by nearly three million people. Hearst did much to create "yellow journalism"--with the emphasis on sensationalism and the lowering of journalistic standards. But Procter shows that Hearst's papers were also challenging and innovative and powerful: They exposed corruption, advocated progressive reforms, strongly supported recent immigrants, became a force in the Democratic Party, and helped ignite the Spanish-American War. Procter vividly depicts Hearst's own political career from his 1902 election to Congress to his presidential campaign in 1904 and his bitter defeats in New York's Mayoral and Gubernatorial races. <br> Written with a broad narrative sweep and based on previously unavailable letters and manuscripts, <em>William Randoph Hearst</em> illuminates the character and era of the man who left an indelible mark on American journalism.<br></p><p>William Randolph Hearst was one of the most colorful and important figures of turn-of-the-century America, a man who changed the face of American journalism and whose influence extends to the present day.

Making extensive use of church documents, Michael Phayer explores the actions of the Catholic Church and the actions of individual Catholics during the crucial period from the emergence of Hitler until the Church's official rejection of antisemitism in 1965. Phayer's account permits us to follow the evolution of official Catholic thinking during the rebuilding of Germany, the Cold War, and the gradual theological reforms that led to Vatican II.<p>Pope Pius XII did not cause the Holocaust, nor was it within his power to stop it. Why then is he the center of controversy, most recently as ""Hitler's Pope""? For Michael Phayer, casting the spotlight relentlessly on Pius XII has skewed the question surrounding Catholicism and the Holocaust, depriving us of a record of what the entire Church did or did not do. Such a record is provided for the first time in the first half of this book. It reveals that European bishops displayed a shocking disparity in their attitudes toward Jews and in their conduct during the Holocaust. On the positive side, the record of those who tried to help Jews is filled with the names of ordinary people.</p><p>The Holocaust ended in 1945 but the Catholic Church did not come to terms with the Shoah until 1965. How this occurred is a story worth telling. Those who perpetrated the Holocaust committed suicide at the end of the war, or were tried and executed after it, or vanished into obscurity. But the men and women who resisted the Holocaust lived on after it to help bring an end to the Church'sequivocal stand on antisemitism.</p></p><p>Michael Phayer is Professor of History at Marquette University. His two most recent books, Protestant Catholic Women in Nazi Germany and (with Eva Fleischner) Cries in the Night: Women Who Challenged the Holocaust, deal extensively with Catholic-Jewish relations before and during the Shoah.Phayer makes an important addition to the literature of Holocaust studies: he provides evidence that Pope Pius XII (who reigned over the Catholic Church from 1939 to 1958) knew in early 1942 what was happening to Europe's Jews (and to non-Jews in Croatia and Poland)Ayet he remained silent. The pope, he argues, was a Germanophile who had been schooled as a diplomat: treaties (particularly one he'd drafted between Germany and Rome in 1933) and the Communist threat were his main priorities. Protection of Vatican City from Allied or Axis bombs was another. Phayer contends that, had the pope resisted the Nazis and informed his flockAeither overtly or through existing secret channelsAabout what was happening, there would have been many more Catholic rescuers and fewer collaborators than there were. Phayer also details the Church's postwar policies; it played its part in helping Nazis escape justice, he contends, rather than support efforts to force Germany to pay reparations to survivors. Phayer, however, doesn't only describe the years of Pius XII; he contrasts him with Pope Pius XI and Pope John XXIII (who respectively preceded and followed him), and in doing so he makes a forceful point about the difference strong leadership can make. Both Pius XI and John XXIII used their positions of infallibility to openly and publicly encourage cordiality and acceptance of Jews, culminating in the Church's 1965 declaration that the Jews were not responsible for crucifying Jesus. Pius XII, says Phayer, was in contrast a weak leader and a cowardly oneAand the author argues that, given the conditions under which he served, his lack of courage proved devastating. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Becoming a Master Manager: A Competing Values Approach</h2><p>This fifth edition emphasizes the importance of developing management skills or admitted that learning about management concepts was not the same as learning how to apply those concepts in practice.

And rising. And rising. By the time the waters crested, the Ohio and Mississippi had climbed to record heights. Nearly four hundred people had died, while a million more had run from their homes. The deluge caused more than half a billion dollars of damage at a time when the Great Depression still battered the nation.<br><br>Timed to coincide with the flood's seventy-fifth anniversary, <i>The Thousand-Year Flood</i> is the first comprehensive history of one of the most destructive disasters in American history. David Welky first shows how decades of settlement put Ohio valley farms and towns at risk and how politicians and planners repeatedly ignored the dangers. Then he tells the gripping story of the river's inexorable rise: residents fled to refugee camps and higher ground, towns imposed martial law, prisoners rioted, Red Cross nurses endured terrifying conditions, and FDR dispatched thousands of relief workers. In a landscape fraught with dangers&#x2014;from unmoored gas tanks that became floating bombs to powerful currents of filthy floodwaters that swept away whole towns&#x2014;people hastily raised sandbag barricades, piled into overloaded rowboats, and marveled at water that stretched as far as the eye could see. In the flood's aftermath, Welky explains, New Deal reformers, utopian dreamers, and hard-pressed locals restructured not only the flood-stricken valleys, but also the nation's relationship with its waterways, changes that continue to affect life along the rivers to this day.<br><br>A striking narrative of danger and adventure&#x2014;and the mix of heroism and generosity, greed and pettiness that always accompany disaster&#x2014;<i>The Thousand-Year Flood</i> breathes new life into a fascinating yet little-remembered American story.</p></p><p><p><b>David Welky</b> is associate professor of history at the University of Central Arkansas and the author of <i>Everything Was Better in America: Print Culture in the Great Depression</i> and <i>The Moguls and the Dictators: Hollywood and the Coming of World War II</i>.</p><p>"David Welky has done a prodigious job of reminding us about the horror inflicted by the Ohio-Mississippi flood of 1937.

It is always interesting, and often riveting."</p> (Sarah Phillips, author of This Land, This Nation: Conservation, Rural America, and the New Deal)<br><br>"A&nbsp;model of the disaster genre. . . .&nbsp;A comprehensive account, including political maneuvers over flood-control bills provoked by the deluge, this well-wrought history reflects thorough research and on-the-ground acquaintance with the Ohio River region."

It was the mid-1950s, and social scientists were entranced by the human insights promised by Rorschach tests and other innovative scientific protocols. Kaplan, along with anthropologist A. I. Hallowell and a team of researchers, sought out a varied range of non-European subjects among remote and largely non-literate peoples around the globe. Recording their dreams, stories, and innermost thoughts in a vast database, Kaplan envisioned future researchers accessing the data through the cutting-edge Readex machine. Almost immediately, however, technological developments and the obsolescence of the theoretical framework rendered the project irrelevant, and eventually it was forgotten.</p><p><b>Rebecca Lemov</b>&nbsp;is associate professor of the history of science at Harvard University and past visiting scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science.

This critical history traces the formal and conceptual trajectories of art history's favorite form, from Vasari onward, and reconsiders the validity of the life-and-work model for the twenty-first century.</b></p><p>The narrative of the artist's life and work is one of the oldest models in the Western literature of the visual arts. In <i>Art as Existence</i>, Gabriele Guercio investigates the metamorphosis of the artist's monograph, tracing its formal and conceptual trajectories from Vasari's sixteenth-century <i>Lives of the Painters, Sculptors, and Architects</i> (which provided the model and source for the genre) through its apogee in the nineteenth century and decline in the twentieth. He looks at the legacy of the life-and-work model and considers its prospects in an intellectual universe of deconstructionism, psychoanalysis, feminism, and postcolonialism.</p><p>Since Vasari, the monograph has been notable for its fluidity and variety; it can be scrupulous and exact, probing and revelatory, poetic and imaginative, or any combination of these. In the nineteenth century, the monograph combined art-historical, biographical, and critical methods, and even added elements of fiction. Guercio explores some significant books that illustrate key phases in the model's evolution, including works by Gustav Friedrich Waagen, A. C. Quatrem�re de Quincy, Johann David Passavant, Bernard Berenson, and others. </p><p>The hidden project of the artist's monograph, Guercio claims, comes from a utopian impulse; by commuting biography into art and art into biography, the life-and-work model equates art and existence, construing otherwise distinct works of an artist as chapters of a life story. Guercio calls for a contemporary reconsideration of the life-and-work model, arguing that the ultimate legacy of the artist's monograph does not lie in its established modes of writing but in its greater project and in the intimate portrait that we gain of the nature of creativity.</p></p><p>Gabriele Guercio is an independent writer living in Milan. He has a doctorate in art history from Yale University and has lectured at the Universities of Rome and Naples. He has been a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts at the National Gallery and a recepient of a J. P. Getty Postdoctoral Fellowship in the History of Art and the Humanities. Editor of <i>Art after Philosophy and After by Joseph Kosuth</i> (MIT Press, 1991) and <i>De Dominicis, Raccolta di scritti sull'opera e l'artista</i>, he has written on modern and contemporary art as well as the history of art theory.<p>An impressively wide-ranging analysis of the monograph from its Renaissance antecedents to the present.</p> (<i>The Art Book</i>)<br><br><p>Independent, passionate, and unexpected.</p> (<i>Artforum</i>)<br><br><p>Guercio's study of the life-and-work model for the understanding of art is impressively comprehensive deeply researched and judiciously argued. It probes the significance of relatively obscure but notable artistic biographies as well as the most celebrated ones. Guercio succeeds in relating modes of biography to the cultural values of their particular historical moment linking artists to the accounts constructed for their careers and hence to a social context.</p> (Richard Shiff, Department of Art and Art History, The University of Texas at Austin)</p><h2>Ghost Stories Of Henry James (Tales of Mystery &amp; the Supernatural)</h2><p>With an Introduction and Notes by Martin Scofield, University of Kent at Canterbury Henry James was arguably the greatest practitioner of what has been called the psychological ghost story.

This revised, updated, and expanded second edition includes two new chapters on the political economy of the Obama era. One presents the Great Recession as a "stress test" of the American political system by analyzing the 2008 election and the impact of Barack Obama's "New New Deal" on the economic fortunes of the rich, middle class, and poor. The other assesses the politics of inequality in the wake of the Occupy Wall Street movement, the 2012 election, and the partisan gridlock of Obama&#x2019;s second term. Larry Bartels offers a sobering account of the barriers to change posed by partisan ideologies and the political power of the wealthy. He also provides new analyses of tax policy, partisan differences in economic performance, the struggle to raise the minimum wage, and inequalities in congressional representation.</p><p>President Obama identified inequality as "the defining challenge of our time." <i>Unequal Democracy</i> is the definitive account of how and why our political system has failed to rise to that challenge. Now more than ever, this is a book every American needs to read.</p></p><p><p>"This book suggests that economists are wrong and that the growing inequality in America is not the product of world forces but of Republican administrations during which income grows more slowly, inequality soars, and no one notices because they pump up the economy during election years. If you care about economic justice, you need to seriously examine the powerful data in this book and recognize that we can choose a better, fairer society."<b>--Robert D. Putnam, author of<i>Bowling Alone</i></b></p><p>"This is a fantastic book, a real tour de force. It is a hugely important study of increasing economic inequality in America and the failure of the political system to mitigate its effects on poor citizens. It is the best work that has been done on the political economy of income inequality."<b>--Thomas E. Patterson, Harvard University</b></p><p>"<i>Unequal Democracy</i>completes the story of why America's wealthy have become superrich. As Larry Bartels, one of the nation's top political scientists, convincingly demonstrates, the rich get richer when the Republicans are in power and when the less affluent fail to vote. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants answers to why so many of America's working- and middle-class families are struggling to get by."<b>SR: Note from editor:</b></p><p>"The book is exemplary throughout in its transparency with regard to the data and Bartels's analytic strategy for using them, in its attention to alternative explanations for a given outcome, and in its balance between not over-reaching and asserting a clear, controversial, and important thesis.... Full of evidence, insights, and surprises.... The book is never less than provocative and is often revelatory."<b>--Gary Orfield, University of California, Los Angeles</b></p><p>"<i>Unequal Democracy</i>is the sort of book to which every political scientist should aspire--it is methodologically rigorous, conceptually serious, and above all, it addresses urgent concerns of our fellow citizens. As Bartels shows, much of what we think we know about the politics of economic inequality is dead wrong. Bartels's perplexing and often unexpected discoveries should help refocus the gathering public debate about inequality and what to do about it."<b>--John J. DiIulio, Jr., University of Pennsylvania, former director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives</b></p><p>"<i>Unequal Democracy</i>is a major landmark in political scientists' efforts to grapple with inequality."<b>--Blake A. Ellis,<i>Journal of Southern History</i></b></p><p>"No political scientist is more widely or rightly respected than Larry Bartels, and<i>Unequal Democracy</i>is a brilliant book that only he could have written. The book proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the main fault for sizable socioeconomic inequalities in America lies not in our economy but in our increasingly polarized and partisan politics. With intellectual force,<i>Unequal Democracy</i>pulls back the sheets on Washington's pamper-the-rich policy process and offers ideas about how we can do better by average citizens and the poor. It is Bartels at his very best, and his very best is the best there is."<b>Must retain Putnam, Mann, and Orfield blurbs on interior praise page</b></p><b>Larry M.

What explains the enduring power of racism and sexism? How does our sociopolitical system generate inequality? These are just a few of the questions explored in this accessible introduction to the complex problem of social stratification.

While fully addressing the most public dimensions of Mapplethorpe's career&#x2014;the branding of his work as pornography and the legal and censorship issues that surround the exhibition of his photographs&#x2014;Danto's essay breaks with common responses by offering a fascinating and deeply sympathetic account of Mapplethorpe's aesthetics.<br><br>In <i>Playing with the Edge</i>, Arthur Danto returns the discussion of Mapplethorpe to a consideration of his artistic legacy. He refuses to retreat from the sexual content of Mapplethorpe's images, claiming that the content and the artistic character of the photographs simultaneously invite and deflect the charges of pornography and together define the importance of Mapplethorpe's work. Danto discerns the images' uniqueness in the relation of trust between the photographer and his subjects.<br><br>Through a fascinating exploration of the relation of Mapplethorpe's images to those of other artists (Titian, Sherman, Winogrand, Cartier-Bresson, Golub) Danto presents a compelling argument for Mapplethorpe's enduring position in the history of art, no less than the history of our times.<br><br><b>FROM THE BOOK</b>:"There is a tension at the heart of Robert Mapplethorpe's art, verging on paradox, between its most distinctive content and its most distinctive mode of presentation. The content of the work is often sufficiently erotic to be considered pornographic, even by the artist, while the aesthetic of its presentation is chastely classic&#x2014;it is Dionysiac and Apollonian at once. The content cannot have been a serious possibility for a major artist at any previous moment in history. It is particular to America in the 1970s, a decade Mapplethorpe exemplifies in terms of his values, his sensibilities, and his attitudes."</p><p>&#34;Calmly reasoned and beautifully measured, Danto&#39;s essay is a paradigm of how serious art criticism ought to proceed should it wish to bring us to see the taste, the delicacy, the complexity and the moral uncertainty of an art object such as Mapplethorpe&#39;s.&#34; (Daniel Herwitz, California State University, Los Angeles)<b>Arthur Danto</b> is Johnsonian Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Columbia University and art critic for <i>The Nation</i>.

Griffin takes us on a guided tour of the recent explosion of scientific research on animal mentality. Are animals consciously aware of anything, or are they merely living machines, incapable of conscious thoughts or emotional feelings? How can we tell? Such questions have long fascinated Griffin, who has been a pioneer at the forefront of research in animal cognition for decades, and is recognized as one of the leading behavioral ecologists of the twentieth century.<br><br>With this new edition of his classic book, which he has completely revised and updated, Griffin moves beyond considerations of animal cognition to argue that scientists can and should investigate questions of animal consciousness. Using examples from studies of species ranging from chimpanzees and dolphins to birds and honeybees, he demonstrates how communication among animals can serve as a "window" into what animals think and feel, just as human speech and nonverbal communication tell us most of what we know about the thoughts and feelings of other people. Even when they don't communicate about it, animals respond with sometimes surprising versatility to new situations for which neither their genes nor their previous experiences have prepared them, and Griffin discusses what these behaviors can tell us about animal minds. He also reviews the latest research in cognitive neuroscience, which has revealed startling similarities in the neural mechanisms underlying brain functioning in both humans and other animals. Finally, in four chapters greatly expanded for this edition, Griffin considers the latest scientific research on animal consciousness, pro and con, and explores its profound philosophical and ethical implications.</p><p>Do animals think? According to Cartesian models of science that have long influenced the Western view of the natural world, they do not: they merely react to external stimuli, the responses to which they cannot control.<p> A different view has emerged in recent years, one that draws on findings from experimental psychology, biology, linguistics, and cognitive ethology. Writes Donald Griffin, an associate at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, "Communicative behavior is not a human monopoly." Animal communication--from the dance language of the bees to the vocalisms of parrots and bonobos--suggests that there is more than a ghost in the machine. For underlying that communicative ability are other powers that humans have no easy way of gauging: a sense of time and futurity, a complex memory, an ability to lie, even consciousness itself.</p><p> Griffin examines recent studies that show that many species are able to discern and classify colors, shapes, materials, and "sameness," and that many other species are able to adapt their communications systems to account for novel situations. Warning that our understanding of animal minds is still ill-formed and that much work remains to be done in the field before we can confidently answer that ancient question one way or the other, he argues that "animals are best viewed as actors who choose what to do, rather than as objects totally dependent on outside influences." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Donald R.

Though he is a profoundly religious poet, even secular readers respond to his quiet intensity and exuberant inventiveness, which are amply showcased in this selection.<br><br>Herbert experimented brilliantly with a remarkable variety of forms, from hymns and sonnets to pattern poems, the shapes of which reveal their subjects. Such technical agility never seems ostentatious, however, for precision of language and expression of genuine feeling were the primary concerns of this poet, who admonished his readers to &#x201c;dare to be true.&#x201d; An Anglican priest who took his calling with deep seriousness, he brought to his work a religious reverence richly allied with a playful wit and with literary and musical gifts of the highest order. His best-loved poems, from &#x201c;The Collar&#x201d; and &#x201c;Jordan&#x201d; to &#x201c;The Altar&#x201d; and &#x201c;Easter Wings,&#x201d; achieve a perfection of form and feeling, a rare luminosity, and a timeless metaphysical grandeur.</p><p>George Herbert&nbsp;was born in 1593, the fifth son of Richard Herbert of Montgomery and Magdalene Herbert, to whom John Donne dedicated his elegy &#x2018;Autumnal Beauty&#x2019;. He was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was appointed Reader in Rhetoric in 1618 and Public Orator in 1620. Herbert was an excellent Greek and Latin scholar and was fluent in Italian, Spanish and French; he was also an accomplished amateur musician. He seemed destined for a great public career and attracted the attention of two powerful and influential figures, the Duke of Richmond and the Marquess of Hamilton, and, when they met, King James I took a liking to him. However, when his two aristocratic patrons, and then, in 1625, King James, all died, any hope of immediate preferment was dashed. In 1626 he resigned his seat in Parliament and took holy orders, becoming Rector of Bemerton, a tiny rural parish on Salisbury Plain, in 1630. In the previous year he had married Jane Danvers after a courtship of only three days, and their marriage was a happy one. Herbert died of consumption at the age of forty on March 1, 1633.Early in 1633 Herbert, aware of his imminent death, sent a copy of his book&nbsp;<i>The Temple</i><b>&nbsp;</b>to his friend Nicholas Ferrar, requesting him to burn it or print it as he saw fit, and two editions were published before the end of that year.&nbsp;<i>The Temple</i><b>&nbsp;</b>comprises almost all his surviving English poems, and it is upon this volume that his reputation rests. His other surviving work includes a set of Latin poems,&nbsp;<i>Memoriae Matris Sacrum,</i> written in memory of his mother; a handful of short occasional poems; two sets of sacred poems,&nbsp;<i>Lucus</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Passio Discerpta</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Musae Responsoriae</i>, a defense of the Church of England against Andrew Melville&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Anti-Tami-Cami-Categoria</i>. Of his prose,&nbsp;<i>A Priest to the Temple</i>, notes on&nbsp;<i>The Hundred and Ten Considerations</i><b>&nbsp;</b>by Juan de Vald�s, the translation of Luigi Cornaro&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Treatise of Temperance and Sobrietie,</i> some of his Latin letters and orations, and a portion of his private correspondence have survived. Thirteen editions of&nbsp;<i>The Temple</i>&nbsp;were published between 1633 and 1679; after that his reputation began to wane. However, the 1799 edition of&nbsp;<i>The Temple</i>&nbsp;heralded a revival, to which Coleridge&#x2019;s appreciation in&nbsp;<i>Biographia Literaria</i>&nbsp;gave a considerable boost: &#x2018;George Herbert is a true poet, but a poet sui generis, the merits of whose poems will never be felt, without a sympathy with the mind and character of the man.&#x2019;</p><h2>Manly Health and Training: To Teach the Science of a Sound and Beautiful Body</h2><p><b>A truly significant discovery, Walt Whitman&#x2019;s <i>Manly Health and Training</i> is an entertaining health manifesto that sheds new light on one of America&#x2019;s major nineteenth-century authors.&nbsp;</b><br><br>In the fall of 1858, a thirteen-part essay series appeared&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<i>New York Atlas</i>, under the title&nbsp;<i>Manly Health and Training.</i>&nbsp;This nearly 47,000-word journalistic effort, written by Walt Whitman under his pen name &#x201c;Mose Velsor,&#x201d; was lost for more than 150 years, buried in just a handful of library archives, until its recent unexpected discovery.<br> <br> What you hold in your hands is a long-lost health manifesto that, remarkably, is as relevant today as it was back in the nineteenth century.

In it he&nbsp;continues his quest for the answer to the greatest&nbsp;&nbsp;puzzle of modern religious scholarship: Who was&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus? To answer this Meier imagines the following&nbsp;&nbsp;scenario: "Suppose that a Catholic, a&nbsp;&nbsp;Protestant, a Jew, and an agnostic were locked up in the&nbsp;&nbsp;bowels of the Harvard Divinity School library... and&nbsp;&nbsp;not allowed to emerge until they had hammered out&nbsp;&nbsp;a consensus document on who Jesus of Nazareth was&nbsp;&nbsp;and what he intended...". <i>A Marginal&nbsp;&nbsp;Jew</i> is what Meier thinks that document&nbsp;&nbsp;would reveal. Volume one concluded with Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;approaching adulthood. Now, in this volume, Meier&nbsp;&nbsp;focuses on the Jesus of our memory and the development&nbsp;&nbsp;of his ministry. To begin, Meier identifies&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus's mentor, the one person who had the greatest&nbsp;&nbsp;single influence on him, John the Baptist. All of the&nbsp;&nbsp;Baptist's fiery talk about the end of time had a&nbsp;&nbsp;powerful effect on the young Jesus and the&nbsp;&nbsp;formulation of his key symbol of the coming of the&nbsp;&nbsp;"kingdom of God." And, finally, we are given a&nbsp;&nbsp;full investigation of one of the most striking&nbsp;&nbsp;manifestations of Jesus's message: Jesus's practice&nbsp;&nbsp;of exorcisms, hearings, and other miracles. In all,&nbsp;&nbsp;Meier brings to life the story of a man, Jesus,&nbsp;&nbsp;who by his life and teaching gradually made himself&nbsp;&nbsp;marginal even to the marginal society that was&nbsp;&nbsp;first century Palestine.</p></p><p></p><h2>Nonlinear Dynamics And Chaos (Studies in Nonlinearity)</h2><p>This essential handbook provides the theoretical and experimental tools necessary to begin researching the nonlinear behavior of mechanical, electrical, optical, and other systems. The book describes several nonlinear systems which are realized by desktop experiments, such as an apparatus showing chaotic string vibrations, an LRC circuit displaying strange scrolling patterns, and a bouncing ball machine illustrating the period doubling route to chaos. Fractal measures, periodic orbit extraction, and symbolic analysis are applied to unravel the chaotic motions of these systems. The simplicity of the examples makes this an excellent book for undergraduate and graduate-level physics and mathematics courses, new courses in dynamical systems, and experimental laboratories.</p><p></p><h2>Edwin Arlington Robinson: A Poet&#39;s Life</h2><p>At the time of his death in 1935, Edwin Arlington Robinson was regarded as the leading American poet-the equal of Frost and Stevens. In this biography, Scott Donaldson tells the intriguing story of this poet's life, based in large part on a previously unavailable trove of more than 3,000 personal letters, and recounts his profoundly important role in the development of modern American literature. <br><br>Born in 1869, the youngest son of a well-to-do family in Gardiner, Maine, Robinson had two brothers: Dean, a doctor who became a drug addict, and Herman, an alcoholic who squandered the family fortune. Robinson never married, but he fell in love as many as three times, most lastingly with the woman who would become his brother Herman's wife. Despite his shyness, Robinson made many close friends, and he repeatedly went out of his way to give them his support and encouragement. <br><br>Still, it was always poetry that drove him. He regarded writing poems as nothing less than his calling-what he had been put on earth to do. Struggling through long years of poverty and neglect, he achieved a voice and a subject matter all his own. He was the first to write about ordinary people and events-an honest butcher consumed by grief, a miser with "eyes like little dollars in the dark," ancient clerks in a dry goods store measuring out their days like bolts of cloth. In simple yet powerful rhetoric, he explored the interior worlds of the people around him. <br><br>Robinson was a major poet and a pivotal figure in the course of modern American literature, yet over the years his reputation has declined. With his biography, Donaldson returns this remarkable talent to the pantheon of great American poets and sheds new light on his enduring legacy.</p><p><p>The first full-scale biography of a great American poet written by a leading literary biographer.</p>Scott Donaldson is one of the nation's leading literary biographers.

Distinguished historian John Riddle provides a cogent analysis of the rulers, wars, and events-both natural and human-that defined the medieval era. Taking a broad geographical perspective, Riddle includes northern and eastern Europe, Byzantium, and the Islamic states. Each, he convincingly shows, offered values and institutions-religious devotion, toleration and intolerance, laws, ways of thinking, and changing roles of women-that presaged modernity. In addition to traditional topics of pen, sword, and word, the author explores other driving forces such as science, religion, and technology in ways that previous textbooks have not. He also examines such often-overlooked issues as medieval gender roles and medicine and seminal events such as the crusades from the vantage point of both Muslims and eastern and western Christians.<br><br>In addition to a thorough chronological narrative, the text offers humanizing features to engage students. Each chapter opens with a theme-setting vignette about the lives of ordinary and extraordinary people. The book also introduces students to key controversies and themes in historiography by featuring in each chapter a prominent medieval historian and how his or her ideas have shaped contemporary thinking about the Middle Ages. Richly illustrated, this lively, engaging book will immerse readers in the medieval world, an era that shaped the foundation for the modern world.</p><p><b>John M. Riddle</b> is Alumni Distinguished Professor of History emeritus at North Carolina State University.A lively and fascinating account of the Middle Ages. The intriguing vignettes that open each chapter set the scene for the issues and themes to be explored. Aspects of daily life are teased out not just from written records but also from archaeological remains, surgical instruments, and even analyses of bones and sewage deposits. This novel approach will be of particular interest to all readers wishing a cogent yet compelling account of events that defined the medieval period&#x2014;an era in which the foundations were laid for what was to become modern science and ultimately the industrial revolution. (Emilie Savage-Smith)<br><br>The scope is superior to all other texts on the market&#x2014;best coverage I have seen since Tierney and Painter&#x2019;s <i>Western Europe in the Middle Ages</i>.

(John Hosler)<br><br>In my upper-level overview course on Medieval European History, the biggest challenge I face is the lack of background my students have. This text gives them an understanding of Antiquity and an excellent rehearsal of Islamic history. My students love this book. They found it very helpful in explaining things I didn&#x2019;t have time to cover in class or that they ran into in their own research. A number said this was one of the books they would keep rather than selling back. That&#x2019;s a big compliment. This text is easier&#x2014;and in my opinion more interesting&#x2014;to read than many of the newer texts currently available, or the old-reliable Canter. It is better in its approach than the other popular versions and more up to date. (Wendy Turner)<br><br>Very comprehensive yet readable. The scope is a good balance between broad strokes and specific details. The impressive historiographic sections reinforce the historiography that I incorporate in my course. The author adeptly weaves humor and modern examples into the narrative to illustrate points about medieval history.

(Mary Kathryn Robinson)<br><br>Inclusive in its coverage and innovative in approach, John Riddle's survey of medieval history offers a first-rate introduction that will prove invaluable to those embarking on the study of this richly diverse period. Features of special note include Riddle's highlighting of key medieval texts and his evaluations of the contributions made by leading modern scholars to major historical debates. The list of judiciously selected Internet resources that supplements the bibliography at the end of each chapter will prove particularly useful to the new generation of readers.

Forced to work with a tripod and the larger format of 4-by-5-inch film, he was providentially assigned to photograph a neurosurgeon as she worked. This ultimately gave birth to <i>The Sacred Heart</i>, a magnificent and utterly disturbing collection of photographs of the human body seen through invasive surgery.<p> There is nothing like this collection either in the annals of medical photography or the arts. Almost 50 surgical procedures--a liver transplant, a mastectomy, the harvesting of organs after death, a cesarean birth, and others--cause us to look away and immediately look back. Surgeons' hands hover gracefully over gaping wounds, and lighting on gloves, instruments, and bare flesh is both theatrical and holy.</p><p> Aguilera-Hellweg's essay integrates the photographs and historic information about early surgical procedures with his own philosophic musings. <i>The Sacred Heart</i> inspires terror, pity, and awe as our gaze lingers on these horrific images.</p></p><h2>Health Care Law and Ethics, Eighth Edition</h2><p><b>Health Care Law and Ethics </b>is the definitive casebook for covering all aspects of the dynamic field of health care law, including thought-provoking discussions of topical and controversial subject such as gene patenting and DNA banks.

Cohen's <i>Discovering History in China</i> has occupied a singular place in American China scholarship. Translated into three East Asian languages, the volume has become essential to the study of China from the early nineteenth century to today. <br><br>Cohen critiques the work of leading postwar scholars and is especially adamant about not reading China through the lens of Western history. To this end, he uncovers the strong ethnocentric bias pervading the three major conceptual frameworks of American scholarship of the 1950s and 1960s: the impact-response, modernization, and imperialism approaches. In place of these, Cohen favors a "China-centered" approach in which historians understand Chinese history on its own terms, paying close attention to Chinese historical trajectories and Chinese perceptions of their problems, rather than a set of expectations derived from Western history. In an important new introduction, Cohen reflects on his fifty-year career as a historian of China and discusses major recent trends in the field. Although some of these developments challenge a narrowly conceived China-centered approach, insofar as they enable more balanced comparisons between China and the West and recast the Chinese and their history in more human, less exotic terms, they powerfully affirm the central thrust of Cohen's work.</p><p>A critical reassessment of the reception of China&#39;s history in American historical writing.Paul A.

It supplies background information from fields which may not be everyone&#39;s speciality, such as biology and mythology. It gives not one, but several meanings which may apply simultaneously, since indefiniteness is the mark of symbols. No fine distinction is made between symbols, allegories, metaphors, signs, types or images, since such subtle distinctions, however sensible from a scientific point of view, are useless to a person struggling with the deeper comprehension, and thus appreciation, of a particular &#39;symbol&#39;. Important general entries are listed such as archetypes, ass, binary, bull, calendar, eagle, elements, Great Goddess, Sacred King, sun, etc., which it is advisable to read first. Information was gathered from primary sources: both famous and obscure classical authors; the Bible; the medieval scholar and musician Hildegard von Bingen; but also Donne, Shakespeare and Eliot. Lists of primary and secondary literature are included. From the many notes left behind by the late Ad de Vries, his son has gathered enough new material to enlarge the original 1974 edition more than 20 per cent.

Both a calendar of daily rituals and a witty sequence of stories recounted in a variety of styles, it weaves together tales of gods and citizens together to explore Rome&#39;s history, religious beliefs and traditions. It may also be read as a subtle but powerful political manifesto which derides Augustus&#39; attempts to control his subjects by imposing his own mythology upon them: after celebrating the emperor as a Jupiter-on-earth, for example, Ovid deliberately juxtaposes a story showing the king of the gods as a savage rapist. Endlessly playful, this is also a work of integrity and courage, and a superb climax to the life of one of Rome&#39;s greatest writers.</p><p>Book IV of Ovid&#39;s celebration of the calendar and the associated legends of the Roman year treats the month of April, a particularly happy phase of the Augustan ceremonial year. Around the festival of Venus and the anniversary of the foundation of Rome Ovid retells the legends of Rome&#39;s royal found Romulus and the Trojan hero Aeneas. The introduction and commentary pay special attention to Ovid&#39;s art as a poet, but aim to provide both the general background and specific explanations of his historical and religious material.Ovid&#39;s Fasti, begun in or soon after AD I, was to have celebrated the calendar and associated legends of the Roman year, but probably had reached no further than June before his exile in AD 8. Book IV, the book of April, honours the festivals of Venus, Cybele, Ceres and their cult, as well as the traditional date of the foundation of Rome and many religious and civic anniversaries. Elaine Fantham accompanies her commentary with a revised text and a deliberately extended introduction. Besides including surveys of language, style, versification and textual transmission, the introduction looks at the shifting generic traditions of Greek and Roman elegy, and situates Ovid&#39;s composite poem in its Augustan literary and historical context.</p><h2>Body, Memory, and Architecture (Yale Paperbound)</h2><p>As teachers of architectural design, Kent Bloomer and Charles Moore have attempted to introduce architecture from the standpoint of how buildings are experienced, how the affect individuals and communities emotionally and provide us with a sense of joy, identity, and place. <br>In giving priority to these issues and in questioning the professional reliance on abstract two-dimensional drawings, they often find themselves in conflict with a general and undebated assumption that architecture is a highly specialized system with a set of prescribed technical goals, rather than a sensual social art historically derived from experiences and memories of the human body. This book, an outgrowth of their joint teaching efforts, places the human body at the center of our understanding of architectural form. <br><i>Body, Memory, and Architecture</i> traces the significance of the body from its place as the divine organizing principle in the earliest built forms to its near elimination from architectural thought in this century. The authors draw on contemporary models of spatial perception as well as on body-image theory in arguing for a return of the body to its proper place in the architectural equation. <br></p><p>This book is a product of our joint efforts to teach fundamentals of architectural design to first-year professional students at the Yale School of Architecture.</p><h2>History of Italian Renaissance art: Painting, sculpture, architecture</h2><p>An updated edition of a classic study in art history provides an extended list of considered works and draws on the latest research to provide a thorough examination of the development of Italian Renaissance painting, sculpture, and architecture.</p><p>Long hailed as one of the most comprehensive and richly detailed chronologies of painting, sculpture, and architecture in Italy from c. 1200 A.D. to c. 1594 A. D., this volume focuses on the works of art, their creators, and the circumstances affecting their creation.<p> Frederick Hartt's <i>History of Italian Renaissance Art</i> remains an unrivaled classic. As absorbing to read as it is authoritative in content, the book covers over four centuries of Italian painting, sculpture, and architecture. Its sumptuous color illustrations, fine writing, and in-depth scholarship bring into focus all the elements of this extraordinarily creative period and the amazing personalities who gave it life. Building on the book's more than thirty-year tradition, revising author David G. Wilkins skillfully blends new scholarly discoveries with Hartt's original emphasis on stylistic developments between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. Wilkins's approach retains the enthusiasm and appreciation that Hartt so successfully conveyed to generations of students and admirers of Italian Renaissance art. </p> <p> The fifth edition has a striking new design with more than half the works of art now illustrated in color. A lavish color portfolio of the Italian Renaissance opens the book and launches the reader on a dazzling adventure across time. New views of frescoes and sculptures photographed in their original locations offer a dynamic insight into the way Renaissance men and women experienced their art. Since the release of the fourth edition, many more works have been restored, including Michelangelo's <i>Last Judgment</i> in the Sistine Chapel and Raphael's Stanze frescoes in the Vatican. Fresh views of renowned works are included with art commissioned or produced by women. Extended captions identify Renaissance patrons and provide details about historical context, emphasizing how art was created and why, while in-depth visual analysis clarifies the aesthetic developments that emerged in key artistic centers such as Florence, Rome, Venice, and Siena. New iconographic diagrams and computerized reconstructions add dimension to the meanings behind classical, secular, and sacred motifs. Architectural plans, maps in color, and an expanded glossary and bibliography complete this well-rounded picture of the Italian Renaissance. </p> <p> Frederick Hartt and David Wilkins's <i>History of Italian Renaissance Art</i> invites us to experience a rich artistic legacy in painting, sculpture, and architecture. Through an engaging narrative complemented by a cascade of illustrations, Hartt and Wilkins connect us with the remarkable artists whose innovations and visions shaped the Renaissance. </p></p><h2>Contemporary Cultures of Display (Art and Its Histories Series)</h2><p>Focusing on the place of art in contemporary culture, this work discusses museums, galleries and exhibitions in Western Europe and the USA.

C. Benson. Benson was educated at Eton College and then studied classics and theology at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1890 to 1893. In 1895, Benson was ordained a priest in the Church of England by his father, who was the then Archbishop of Canterbury. After his father died suddenly in 1896, Benson was sent on a trip to the Middle East to recover his own health. While there he began to question the status of the Church of England and to consider the claims of the Roman Catholic Church. His own piety began to tend toward the High Church tradition, and he started exploring religious life in various Anglican communities, eventually obtaining permission to join the Community of the Resurrection. Benson made his profession as a member of the community in 1901, at which time he had no thoughts of leaving the Church of England. As he continued his studies and began writing, however, he became more and more uneasy with his own doctrinal position and, on 11 September 1903, he was received into the Catholic Church. He was awarded the Dignitary of Honour of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. Benson was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1904 and sent to Cambridge. He continued his writing career along with his ministry as a priest. Like both his brothers, Edward Frederic Benson (&#34;Fred&#34;) and Arthur Christopher Benson, Robert wrote many ghost and horror stories, as well as children&#39;s stories and historical fiction. His horror and ghost fiction are collected in The Light Invisible (1903) and A Mirror of Shallott (1907). His novel, Lord of the World (1907), is generally regarded as one of the first modern dystopian novels (see List of dystopian literature). The bibliography below reveals a prodigious output. Benson died in 1914 in Salford, where he had been preaching a mission. He was 42. At his request, he was buried in the orchard of Hare Street House, his house in the Hertfordshire village of Hare Street. A chapel, dedicated to St Hugh, was built over the site. Benson bequeathed the house to the Catholic Church as a county retreat for the Archbishop of Westminster. The Roman Catholic church in the nearby town of Buntingford, which he helped finance, is dedicated to St Richard of Chichester, but also known as the Benson Memorial Church.</p><h2>God Help Me!

It was an American suburb. In this innovative and timely history, Andrew Friedman chronicles how the CIA and other national security institutions created a U.S. imperial home front in the suburbs of Northern Virginia. In this covert capital, the suburban landscape provided a cover for the workings of U.S. imperial power, which shaped domestic suburban life. The Pentagon and the CIA built two of the largest office buildings in the country there during and after the war that anchored a new imperial culture and social world. <br><br>As the U.S. expanded its power abroad by developing roads, embassies, and villages, its subjects also arrived in the covert capital as real estate agents, homeowners, builders, and landscapers who constructed spaces and living monuments that both nurtured and critiqued postwar U.S. foreign policy. Tracing the relationships among American agents and the migrants from Vietnam, El Salvador, Iran, and elsewhere who settled in the southwestern suburbs of D.C., Friedman tells the story of a place that recasts ideas about U.S. immigration, citizenship, nationalism, global interconnection, and ethical responsibility from the post-WW2 period to the present. Opening a new window onto the intertwined history of the American suburbs and U.S. foreign policy, <i>Covert Capital </i> will also give readers a broad interdisciplinary and often surprising understanding of how U.S. domestic and global histories intersect in many contexts and at many scales.<br><br>American Crossroads, 37<br></p><p><i>"</i>Amongst the book&#x2019;s many achievements, it provides an exemplary analysis of the myriad ways in which everyday, intimate, and &#x2018;local&#x2019; circuits of power have been deeply imbricated in the ongoing rollout of imperial geopolitics since the mid-20th century."&#x2014;Jamie Peck,&nbsp;<i>Progress in Human Geography</i><br><br>"This spatial and cultural analysis of seemingly innocuous suburban sprawl offers a compelling picture of a nation that could both deny and pursue Empire simultaneously.

S. intervention, Andrew Friedman&#x2019;s <i>Covert Capital</i> introduces readers to some of mid-to-late twentieth-century suburbia&#x2019;s open secrets: autocratic allies ensconced in leafy cul-de-sacs, other nations&#x2019; futures worked out at poolside, cocktail chatter crossing CIA assets with real estate assets.&nbsp; In problematizing the boundaries between the foreign and the domestic, and the political and the personal, and in its subtle, interdisciplinary readings of spatial practice and architectural form, <i>Covert Capital</i> is essential reading for scholars seeking to interpret the landscapes of American global power."<br> &#x2014;Paul A. Kramer,&nbsp;author of <i>The Blood of Government: Race, Empire, the United States and the Philippines</i><br><br> &#x201c;In this highly innovative history of the U.S. empire, Andrew Friedman carefully delineates the suburban architecture that shaped even as it camouflaged America's global reach. In tracing the emergence of Northern Virginia as the nation's 'covert capital,' he relocates the foreign in the domestic, showing the local sources of imperial power and the quotidian making of its multi-cultural agents. Ever attentive to the ironies of empire, Friedman deepens our understanding of American power by revealing the material designs of its elaborate disavowals.&#x201c;<br> &#x2014;Vicente L.

Chicago residents knowingly move among familiar creatures like squirrels, pigeons, and dogs, but might be surprised to learn about all the leafhoppers and water bears, black-crowned night herons and bison, beavers and massasauga rattlesnakes that are living alongside them. <i>City Creatures</i> introduces readers to an astonishing diversity of urban wildlife with a unique and accessible mix of essays, poetry, paintings, and photographs.<br> The contributors bring a story-based approach to this urban safari, taking readers on birding expeditions to the Magic Hedge at Montrose Harbor on the North Side, canoe trips down the South Fork of the Chicago River (better known as Bubbly Creek), and insect-collecting forays or restoration work days in the suburban forest preserves.<br><br> The book is organized into six sections, each highlighting one type of place in which people might encounter animals in the city and suburbs. For example, schoolyard chickens and warrior wasps populate &#x201c;Backyard Diversity,&#x201d; live giraffes loom at the zoo and taxidermy-in-progress pheasants fascinate museum-goers in &#x201c;Animals on Display,&#x201d; and a chorus of deep-freeze frogs awaits in &#x201c;Water Worlds.&#x201d; Although the book is rooted in Chicago&#x2019;s landscape, nature lovers from cities around the globe will find a wealth of urban animal encounters that will open their senses to a new world that has been there all along.

Readers in the first group are drawn to mental recreational activities such as chess. bridge. and various types of puzzles. but they generally do not respond enthusiastically to mathematics because of their unhappy learning experiences with it during their school days. The readers in the secondgrouptum to mathematics as a necessity. but with painful resignation and considerable apprehension regarding their abilities to master the branch ofmathematics they need in their work. In either case. the fear of and revulsion to mathematics felt by these readers usually stem from their earlier frustrating encounters with it. vii viii PREFACE This book will show these readers that these fears, frustrations, and general antipathy are unwarranted, for, as stated, it is not a textbook full of long, boring proofs and hundreds of problems, rather it is an intellectual adventure, to be read with pleasure. It was written to be easily accessible and with concern for the mental tranquilityofthe reader who willexperience considerable fulfillment when he/she sees the simplicity of basic mathematics. The emphasis throughout this book is on the clear explanation of mathematical con� cepts.</p><p>In the straightforward, accessible fashion that has become their hallmark, these eloquent authors calmly lead the most fearful readers through the fundamentals of practical arithmetic and beyond.This book by the authors of The Concepts of Science ( LJ 5/15/88) aims to present mathematics in a palatable way for persons who need to master some of the basics but who bear unhappy memories of mathematics from their school days. Topics covered include arithmetic, elementary algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus; the material is mainly at a high school and college freshman level. Although some attention is paid to applications, the authors concentrate on a simplified walkthrough of the mathematical details. Rigorous proofs are not generally supplied; this is understandable and acceptable in view of the intended audience. The book should prove comprehensible for readers with a "need-to-know," but a high level of self-motivation is required; the approach is rather pedestrian and uninspiring. However, this book may be of interest to school and public libraries.<br><i>-Jack W.

Bront�'s enigmatic heroine becomes the object of gossip and jealousy as neighbors learn she is escaping from an abusive marriage and living under an assumed name. A daring story that exposed the dark brutality of Victorian chauvinism, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was nevertheless attacked by some critics as a celebration of the same excesses it criticized.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every reader who has felt the power of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights comes, sooner or later, to The Tenant of Wildfell Hall," observed Bront� scholar Margaret Lane. "Anne Bront�, with all the Bront� taste for violence and drama, and with her experience of the same rude scenes and savage Yorkshire tales that had fed the imaginations of her sisters, did not shrink. She used the material at hand, and shaped it with singular honesty and seri-<br>ousness....Anne is a true Bront�." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This edition of The Tenant of Wildfell <br>Hall is the companion volume to the Mobil Masterpiece Theatre WGBH television presentation broadcast on PBS.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

How has the science of ornithology developed over the past centuries? This educational and entertaining book explores the history of ornithology from the earliest times to the present day, vividly describing the ornithologists who have been most influential in their field and the discoveries they have made. The book begins by surveying writings on birds by the ancient Chinese, Greeks, and Romans and by individuals writing during the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Age of Exploration. It then assesses such ornithological pioneers as Linnaeus, Brisson, and Buffon, whose contributions to the foundations of ornithological systematics and collecting are seminal. Subsequent chapters discuss the expeditions of the eighteenth century; the work of the Germans and the Dutch; the beginnings of ornithology in America; the development of nineteenth-century systems of classification; the new theories that emerged from the Far East; and the great advances made in the twentieth century. Attractively illustrated and engagingly written, the book will be of great interest to all birders and naturalists.</p><p>Published in association with A &amp; C Black/Helm&#34;This exhilarating account of the history of ornithology is a most enjoyable and important work.&#34;-Jon Ahlquist, coauthor of Phylogeny and Classification of Birds of the World</p><h2>Phillips&#39;s Manual of I.V.

Jeffrey C. Alexander's masterful work, <em>The Civil Sphere</em>, addresses this central paradox of modern life. Feelings for others--the solidarity that is ignored or underplayed by theories of power or self-interest--are at the heart of this novel inquiry into the meeting place between normative theories of what we think we should do and empirical studies of who we actually are. Solidarity, Alexander demonstrates, creates inclusive and exclusive social structures and shows how they can be repaired. It is not perfect, it is not absolute, and the horrors which occur in its lapses have been seen all too frequently in the forms of discrimination, genocide, and war. Despite its worldly flaws and contradictions, however, solidarity and the project of civil society remain our best hope: the antidote to every divisive institution, every unfair distribution, every abusive and dominating hierarchy. This grand, sweeping statement and rigorous empirical investigation is a major contribution to our thinking about the real but ideal world in which we all reside.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jeffrey C. Alexander</strong> is Lillian Chavenson Saden Professor of Sociology at Yale University, and a Director of the Center for Cultural Sociology. He is also the author of <em>The Meanings of Social Life: A Cultural Sociology</em> (Oxford, 2003).<br><br>"<em>The Civil Sphere</em> offers grand theorizing in ways that remind us of both what we are and what we can be. Jeffrey Alexander offers sociology at least a place from which it may begin again."--<em>The New Republic</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Civil Sphere</em> is [a] crowning achievement ... that masterfully reconnects the normative and the empirical in ways that fill an important gap in our cultural discourse today ... A work of great importance, an enduring contribution to the literature on civil society and democracy. Its influence will be felt in political, cultural, and theoretical sociology for decades to come."--<em>American Journal of Sociology</em><p></p><br>"[This] is a book about the need to place justice at the centre of the sociological enterprise... One of its most distinctive and welcome features is its insistence that good social theories have a disclosing power that is practically efficacious... Its most significant contribution...is its presentation of a strong vision of civil society and the case it makes for taking up the project of civil repair. By arguing persuasively that the civil sphere is a great achievement of Western modernity, and by encouraging us to work towards its realization, the book itself is a remarkable achievement."--<em>Philosophy and Social Criticisms</em><p></p><br>"A genuine masterpiece ... America's best, and best-known, social theorist defends the project of civil society and its utopia of democratic inclusion--not only as an ideal, but also as an idea, which is already partly institutionalized."--<em>Constellations</em><p></p><br>"This subtle and hugely informative work ... offers not only acute theoretical discussion of the civil society concept, but also generous and expansive accounts of social movements of race and gender, and the theory and practice of multiculturalism and assimilation (two chapters on the Jewish experience are especially compelling)."--<em>Contemporary Sociology</em><p></p><br><em>The Civil Sphere</em> offers a bold and original thesis about the critically important role that civil societies play in Western democracies. Although I will challenge Alexander's thesis, it is important to state at the outset that <em>The Civil Sphere</em> is a valuable book packed with rich social histories, lively engagements with ancient and contemporary theories, and novel interpretations. There is much to be learned here about the historic and sociological nature of racial, gender, and ethnic oppressions, and the struggles waged to over throw them."--Aldon Morris <em>Sociological Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Civil Sphere</em> is truly a masterful and groundbreaking work, the rare and ambitious kind that does not just contribute to one of the many ongoing conversations in sociology, but brings them together and reorients them. It will undoubtedly confirm and reinforce Jeffrey Alexander's reputation as one of the foremost sociological theorists of our day. Indeed, reading <em>The Civil Sphere</em> generated the same sense of intellectual excitement that I experienced the first time I read Durkheim or Weber or Habermas--and for similar reasons: <em>The Civil Sphere</em> addresses big and important questions about freedom, inequality, and solidarity."--Chad Goldberg, <em>Sociological Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"All sociologists, social scientists or writers probably nurture some secret ambition of writing a mega book that will immortalize them by its originality, the persuasiveness of arguments, impact, or its sheer size. For Jeffrey Alexander this is it. A magisterial book, a contribution to social theory that will be talked about, criticized and never overlooked."--<em>Asian Journal of Social Science</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Civil Sphere</em> is ... rich in its empirical descriptions and resourceful and suggestive in terms of its conceptual and theoretical framework. The book will challenge and shape the discussions in cultural sociology for many years to come."--<em>Cultural Sociology</em><p></p><br>"From the point of view of contemporary sociology, one of its most distinctive and welcome features is its judicious use of sociological theory and data to advance a particular vision of justice. As such it is a book about the need to place justice at the centre of the sociological enterprise. From the point of view of contemporary critical social theory, one of its most distinctive and welcome features is its insistence that good social theories have a disclosing power that is practically efficacious. As such it is also a book about the illuminating power of theory. Its most significant contribution, however, is its presentation of a strong vision of civil society and the case it makes for taking up the project of civil repair. By arguing persuasively that the civil sphere is a great achievement of Western modernity, and by encouraging us to work towards its realization, the book itself is a remarkable achievement."--<em>Philosophy and Social Criticisms</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Civil Sphere</em> is a major work that is going to change the state of the debate in many fields ... It aims to provide a new theory of contemporary society, based on a new interpretation of solidarity [that] is a radical challenge to political economy."--<em>European Journal of Social Theory</em><p></p><br>"A tour de force of sociology, political science, and philosophy, [its] repercussions might be felt for decades to come ... This is a book worth reading by both social scientists and the general public, for its persuasiveness can inspire us to imagine that another world is possible"--<em>Mediterranean</em> <em>Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"All sociologists, social scientists or writers probably nurture some secret ambition of writing a mega book that will immortalize them by its originality, the persuasiveness of arguments, impact, or its sheer size. For Jeffrey Alexander, this is it. A magisterial book, a contribution to social theory that will be talked about, criticized and never overlooked."--<em>Asian Journal of Social Science</em><p></p><br>"Jeffrey Alexander's <em>The Civil Sphere</em> is nothing less than an attempt to create a new theory of civil society for the 21st century through an almost equally ambitious attempt to reground the discipline of sociology."--<em>Journal of Communication</em><p></p><br>"A major work of cultural and political sociology, exploring the possibilities of civility as action and civil sphere as a public domain ... <em>The Civil Sphere</em> can taken as conclusive evidence that sociology is alive and well, and more importantly relevant to modern social action."--<em>Citizenship</em> <em>Studies</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Civil Sphere</em> is the best book in sociology that I have read in many years ... It will find its place on the shelf with the other great classics of sociology. [A] great work."--<em>Perspectives: Newsletter of the Theory Section of the American Sociological Association</em><p></p><br>"The book is an exercise in forging theory as a tool for democratic practice."--<em>Thesis Eleven</em><p></p><br>"Arguably the most probing and insightful examination of civil society in America since Tocqueville's <em>Democracy in America</em>. He offers a penetrating and original causal interpretation of the success of the Civil Rights Movement, and addresses with understanding and fresh perspective the question of Jewish assimilation in post-civil rights America. Alexander's long awaited book establishes a new benchmark for cultural sociology and social theory with its rigorous theoretical and historical analysis of transformative societal change."--Victor Nee, Goldwin Smith Professor of Sociology, Cornell University<p></p><br>"Jeffrey Alexander's <em>The Civil Sphere</em> is the most important, effective, and readable book in his distinguished career. A powerful and provocative account of civil society, this brilliant piece of theorizing is fueled by an expansive moral vision. Alexander punctures the overblown claims of other thinkers both left and right, and stunningly combines theoretical vigor with a subtle, becoming humility in the face of the best achievements and most compelling aspirations of the civil sphere."--Michael Schudson, Professor of Communication, University of California at San Diego<p></p><br>"An original portrait of civil society which addresses issues which must be addressed if we are to live in peace with those unlike ourselves. <em>The Civil Sphere</em> is remarkable for its clarity and depth of exposition. All readers will benefit from Alexander's ideas: he does not try to batter the reader into submission; instead, he embodies the very ideal of civil society, by inviting the reader to argue with him. In sum, an extraordinary and necessary book."--Richard Sennett, Professor of Sociology, The London School of Economics<p></p><br>"This is a Herculean labor in which Alexander not only deconstructs the discourse of 'civil society' but reevaluates the entire tradition of political and social thought which attempted to establish, justify, and actualize this abstract idea."--Hayden White, Professor Emeritus of the History of Consciousness, University of California<p></p><br>"Long recognized as one of the world's foremost intellects, in <em>The Civil Sphere</em> Jeffrey Alexander delivers a masterpiece. In this breathtakingly erudite tour of literature, history, philosophy, and social science scholarship, from Hannah Arendt to Woody Allen, Alexander takes on in a single volume both foundational questions of the human condition and the political exigencies of our day. The result is a book that will wholly transform the conceptual landscape; from this point forward we will recognize that the civil sphere's potential for social justice can only be an ongoing project, never a finished achievement."--Margaret R. Somers, Professor of Sociology, University of Michigan<p></p><br>"<em>The Civil Sphere</em> is at once an energizing ideal for democratic society, and a source of violations of its own ethos. Jeffrey Alexander's well-argued book identifies this crucial level on which liberal democratic societies must operate and offers an insightful and non-reductive account of the struggles against such violations, for what he calls 'civil repair'. He provides fascinating analyses, among other events, of the civil rights movements, and of modern anti-Semitism."--Charles Taylor, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy, McGill University<p></p><br></p><h2>Ulrich &amp; Canale's Nursing Care Planning Guides: Prioritization, Delegation, and Critical Thinking (Nursing Care Planning Guides: For Adults in Acute, Extended and Homecare Settings)</h2><p><p>Practical and comprehensive, this essential resource helps you plan individualized care for clients in a variety of settings, including acute care, extended care, and home care environments.

Often organizations have discussions in order to see what they think, or act in order to see what they want - before they are even aware that a decision has to be made. The effective organization is one that understands this process of sensemaking and learns to manage it with wisdom. The ways in which people do that are demonstrated in chapters of this book.<br> </p> <p>This important collection provides a valuable addition to the international literature on organization theory and will be welcomed by students and researchers alike.</p><b>Karl E.

In <i>The Children's Machine</i> he now looks back over a decade during which American schools acquired more than three million computers and assesses progress and resistance to progress.</p><p><b>Seymour Papert</b> holds the Lego Chair for Learning Research at MIT. He is the author of <i>Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas.</i>The genially unorthodox author of Mindstorms (1983) again makes a stimulating case for computers as a primary route to knowledge, revising and expanding earlier observations in view of disappointing school policies of the past dozen years. Rejecting most schools as ``sluggish and timid'' in assuring access to learning, Papert (Mathematics and Education/MIT) divides the conservative education world into ``Schoolers'' (who acknowledge underlying problems but focus on short-term urgent ones) and ``Yearners'' (who create their own small-scale alternatives) as he considers why technology hasn't revolutionized school learning. Championing computers for offering forms of learning that can be ``quick, immensely compelling, and rewarding,'' Papert contends that Logo (the computer language he conceived) is a superior mode of learning for young children, closer to their informal learning style than traditional classroom approaches and invaluable as a medium for most areas of study. But schools have ignored computers' broad capacities, he finds, isolating these tools from the learning process instead of integrating them into all areas of instruction. Papert offers a steady supply of examples--from his own extensive experience as well as from assorted classrooms--providing evidence of computers as powerful learning allies. He also understands the nature of learning--the importance of the personal element in any classroom exchange; the need to adapt a learning-environment design to its social and cultural milieu; the ``internal censors'' that students bring to required work; and the way that ordered ideas can emerge from an imprecise, undirected process. Even those who resist Papert's belief that the foundation of modern schooling is faulty will agree with his central theme that the ability to learn new skills is the most critical skill of all- -and that computers have a unique, accelerating role to play in developing that ability. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This remarkable collection of 14 short stories offers insights into what it means to be deaf in a hearing world. The book is divided into three parts: the first section explores works by nineteenth-century authors; the second section concentrates on stories by twentieth-century writers; and the final section focuses on stories by authors who are themselves deaf. Each section begins with an introduction by the editors and each story is preceded by a preface. Angels and Outcasts concludes with an annotated bibliography of other prose works about the Deaf experience. In addition to fascinating reading, it provides valuable insights into the world of Deaf people.</p><p>The editors are not enthralled, as so many of us seem to be, simply that deaf (or disabled) characters exist in literature; they ask why... .

What emerges is a world on the cusp of change. By convention, middle-class girls stayed at home, where their reading exposed them to powerful images of self-sacrificing women. Yet in reality girls in their teens increasingly attended schools&#x2015;especially newly opened high schools, where they outnumbered boys. There they competed for grades and honor directly against male classmates. Before and after school they joined a public world beyond adult supervision&#x2015;strolling city streets, flagging down male friends, visiting soda fountains.<br><br>Poised between childhood and adulthood, no longer behaving with the reserve of &#x201c;young ladies,&#x201d; adolescent females sparred with classmates and ventured new identities. In leaving school, female students left an institution that had treated them more equally than any other they would encounter in the course of their lives. Jane Hunter shows that they often went home in sadness and regret. But over the long term, their school experiences as &#x201c;girls&#x201d; foreshadowed both the turn-of-the-century emergence of the independent &#x201c;New Woman&#x201d; and the birth of adolescence itself. <br></p><p>&#34;A beautiful and important book. From an extraordinarily rich range of sources, Hunter has recreated a fascinating world of venturesome spirits, who speak -- often eloquently and movingly -- for themselves.&#34; Jackson Lears, Rutgers University<b>Jane H.

These three plays recount the murder of Agamemnon by his queen Clytemnestra on his return from Troy with the captive Trojan princess Cassandra; the murder in turn of Clytemnestra by their son Orestes; and Orestes' subsequent pursuit by the Avenging Furies (Eumenides) and eventual absolution.<br><br>Hugh Lloyd-Jones's informative notes elucidate the text, and introductions to each play set the trilogy against the background of Greek religion as a whole and Greek tragedy in particular, providing a balanced assessment of Aeschylus's dramatic art.</p><p>"By far the best translation.

There he meets David Smith, a medical student recovering from drug addiction, and the two men begin a tennis ritual that allows them to shed their inhibitions and find security in the sport they love and with each other. This friendship between doctor and intern grows increasingly rich and complex, more intimate than two men usually allow. Just when it seems nothing can go wrong, the dark beast from David&#x2019;s past emerges once again&#x2014;and almost everything Verghese has come to trust and believe in is threatened as David spirals out of control. </p></p><p>What is it about sports that makes some men wax as mystical as a Castanedan Yaqui? In the hands of writers such as David James Duncan and Norman Maclean, the simple, repetitive motions of baseball, fly-fishing, and golf have acquired almost numinous significance. In <i>The Tennis Partner</i>, Dr. Abraham Verghese takes on his own fascination with tennis and comes up with as good an explanation as any: "In the way we controlled the movement of a yellow ball in space, we were imposing <i>order</i> on a world that was fickle and capricious. Each ball that we put into play, for as long as it went back and forth between us, felt like a charm to be added to a necklace full of spells, talismans, and fetishes, which one day add up to an Aaron's rod, an Aladdin's lamp, a magic carpet. Each time we played, this feeling of restoring order, of mastery, was awakened." <p> For both Verghese and his tennis partner, a fourth-year medical student named David Smith, the game is a much-needed island of order in the midst of personal chaos. Both men are struggling to rebuild their lives, Verghese undergoing a painful divorce, Smith struggling with an intravenous cocaine addiction. For a brief, idyllic period, their friendship flourishes; Verghese mentors Smith in the examining room, while Smith, an Australian who competed briefly on the pro circuit, ends up Verghese's teacher on the court. But there are dark corners to David's personality, and under the mounting pressures of medical school and his increasingly complicated love life, these come to the fore. Even as he learns how to inhabit his new life, Verghese watches with horror as his friend relapses, dries out, then relapses again. The author of the powerful <i>My Own Country</i>, a chronicle of caring for AIDS patients in rural Tennessee, Verghese once again proves that the skills of a good doctor are strikingly similar to those of a good writer. Careful observation, compassion, restraint: these are the instruments Verghese uses to stunning effect in <i>The Tennis Partner</i>. A paean to the healing powers of tennis, this book is also a moving meditation on friendship, fatherhood, love, addiction, and the particular loneliness of physicians. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>The first image of what would become Night Ride Home was of a woman very alone in the center of Missouri farmland with something of death around her. I didn&#39;t know her, nor why she was paralyzed by grieving. I wouldn&#39;t suspect for two years that she might fall in love. But I did recognize the place: St. Charles, the small town outside of St. Louis where I grew up. The town of St. Charles was transformed into the place of the novel, Lacote--built on low hills along the Missouri River and surrounded by farmland, much of which was on flood plain. One of my earliest and most powerful memories is standing with my father on a day in 1953 when the river was so high that it overran the river&#39;s steep bank. Rivers and floods, whether real or imagined, shape those people who live with them. While some humans are arrogant enough to believe they can control whatever they put their minds to, floods give a lesson in humility and respect for forces greater than our own. When the land begins to reappear after a flood, we see it piece by piece, the way we do the parts of an answer to a problem we are working out. Or the scenes of a novel being written. Nora, the woman in Night Ride Home, has to try to rebuild her life bit by bit after the death of her son, a death she can no more stop than the Missouri River that floods her land.</p><h2>One Bite at a Time: Nourishing Recipes for Cancer Survivors and Their Friends</h2><p>Through The Inner Cook, her San Francisco Bay Area practice, chef Rebecca Katz teaches creative culinary solutions to peple navigating the aftereffects of cancer treatments.

The study&#39;s use of the female perspective provides an original way of interpreting Russia&#39;s past and important insights into the impact of gender on the ways that Russians defined themselves and others, as well as political change.</p><p>Women in Russia, 1700-2000 is the first book to provide a lively and compelling chronological narrative of women&#39;s experiences from the 17th century to the present. Synthesizing recent scholarship with her own work in primary and archival sources, Barbara Alpern Engel skillfully evokes the voices of individuals to enliven the account, detailing how women of various social strata were affected by and shaped historical change. Adopting the perspective of women provides fresh interpretations of Russia&#39;s past and important insights into the impact of gender on the ways that Russians defined themselves and others, and imagined political change."This lively, rich, and intelligent history of women in Russia will be of great interest to both students and teachers of Russian and Soviet society." Slavic Review<br><br>"In richly textured and graceful prose, the premier historian of Russian women, Barbara Engel, has given us the story of the burdens and conflicts, triumphs and defeats of women in tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union. Bringing in both elite and ordinary women, Russians and the non-Russian peoples, their everyday lives as well as political achievements, she tells a tale, not of steady progress, but of constant struggle against traditional patriarchy, unfulfilled promises of reformers and revolutionaries, and great and small victories always vulnerable to reversal. Here Russia's history is rounded out by the voices of those too often left silent." Professor Ronald Grigor Suny, University of Chicago<br><br>"Many thanks to Barbara Engel for the book we have been waiting for--the first comprehensive history of Russian women... Engel moves expertly from Imperial to Soviet to post-Soviet Russia. A splendid read from start to finish, Women in Russia, 17002000, is learned, vivid, and utterly absorbing. Engel, the top scholar in the field of Russian women's history, is also a skilled storyteller who gives us exactly the right balance of Russian historical context, general narrative, brilliant analysis, and spirited accounts of individual women's lives. Women in Russia is for everyone-- students, scholars, and any reader who appreciates fascinating and vital history at its very best." Nina Tumarkin, Professor of History, Wellesley College, author of Lenin Lives! The Lenin Cult in Soviet Russia (1983) and The Living and the Dead: The Rise and Fall of the Cult of World War II in Russia (1994)<br><br>"Ranging from Peter the Great to the present, from tsarina to peasant, and from village to city, Barbara Engel's sweeping synthesis presents, for the very first time, the full panorama of Russian women's history. Her stories of women and their struggles through the centuries will prove essential to every student and teacher of Russian history." Wendy Z. Goldman, Department of History, Carnegie Mellon University<br><br>"This extraordinary survey combines astute synthesis and telling, sometimes searing detail. The clear and thoughtful narrative carries the reader through three centuries of riveting history, including the critical events of the past fifteen years. Engel is at the top of her form and has written another top-notch book." Bonnie G. Smith, Rutgers University, author of Changing Lives: Women in European History since 1700 (1989).<br><br>"...Engel's book is a success." Christine Ruane, University of Texas, Russian Review<br><br>"Engel's text is essential for Russian historians and for Slavists with an interest in women's studies." Slavic and East European Journal,/i&gt; Erin Collopy, Texas Tech University<br><br>"After thirty-five years of scholarly research on women in Russian history, enough work has appeared to justify a preliminary survey of the topic. Even so, it takes courage to accept the assignment. Despite the many excellent studies now available, large gaps in knowledge remain. Barbara Alpern Engel is to be congratulated for taking on the difficult task of surveying the field and giving an assessment of what we currently know about women in the Russian past. And, indeed, no one is better able to do this, as Englel is herself a pioneer who has contributed much to our knowledge." - Julie Hessler, University of Oregon</p><h2>Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications</h2><p>A new edition of this text, incorporating corrections and an expanded index, has been issued as of September 3, 2013.<br> An engaging introduction to vectors and matrices and the algorithms that operate on them, intended for the student who knows how to program.

It&#x2019;s a chilling shorthand for imminent danger, and a reminder of the countless ways that nature can suddenly snuff us out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet most of us have never seen a timber rattler. Though they&#x2019;re found in thirty-one states, and near many major cities, in contemporary America timber rattlesnakes are creatures mostly of imagination and innate fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ted Levin aims to change that with <i>America&#x2019;s Snake</i>, a portrait of the timber rattlesnake, its place in America&#x2019;s pantheon of creatures and in our own frontier history&#x2014;and of the heroic efforts to protect it against habitat loss, climate change, and the human tendency to kill what we fear. Taking us from labs where the secrets of the snake&#x2019;s evolutionary history are being unlocked to far-flung habitats whose locations are fiercely protected by biologists and dedicated amateur herpetologists alike, Levin paints a picture of a fascinating creature: peaceable, social, long-lived, and, despite our phobias, not inclined to bite. The timber rattler emerges here as emblematic of America and also, unfortunately, of the complicated, painful struggles involved in protecting and preserving the natural world.<br> &nbsp;<br> A wonderful mix of natural history, travel writing, and exemplary journalism, <i>America&#x2019;s Snake</i> is loaded with remarkable characters&#x2014;none more so than the snake at its heart: frightening, perhaps; endangered, certainly; and unquestionably unforgettable.</p><p>A former Bronx Zoo zoologist, <b>Ted Levin</b> is the author of <i>Blood Brook: A Naturalist&#x2019;s Home Ground</i>, <i>Backtracking: The Way of the Naturalist</i>, and <i>Liquid Land: A Journey through the Everglades</i>, which won the Burroughs Medal in 2004. He has written for <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, <i>Audubon</i>, <i>National Wildlife</i>, <i>National Geographic Traveler</i>, and other publications."The compelling story of a much-maligned critter. . . . Levin's adventures with herpetologists and dedicated amateur reptile enthusiasts will enlighten and entertain; the not-so-careful work of poachers and bounty hunters will disgust. The author's wry humor peppers the text. . . . Sensitive to the singular beauty of the snakes, Levin is also exquisitely attuned to the larger rhythms of nature, as alive to what's singing in the trees as what's slithering in the leaves underfoot. This book resonates with wit, love, and wonder--a feat, considering the vexed reputation of its subject. Readers, perhaps even ophidiophobic ones, will come away with a fresh appreciation for a creature with 'the toxic bite and admonishing tail.'"<br> &nbsp; (<i>Library Journal, starred review</i>)<br><br>"<i>America's Snake</i> explains the history and decline of one of the more besieged species of rattlesnake, the timber rattlesnake. . . . Levin provides the reader with a comprehensive overview of rattlesnake biology, as well as setting out the current threats to the species' persistence. . . . His portrayals of scientists, reptile breeders, and nature enthusiasts are particularly refreshing." (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Levin brings to his study a poet&#x2019;s touch and makes our long battle with rattlers emblematic of a larger story.&#x201d; (<i>The Week</i>)<br><br>"One of the ten best nature books of the year. Ted Levin's passionate, eloquent book is a prolonged love letter to the American timber rattler, a horn-faced engine of venom that Levin nevertheless finds not only beautiful but inspiring. And regardless of how many times you yourself may have been bitten by this allegedly peaceful creature, you&#x2019;ll certainly find the book&#x2019;s prose beautiful and inspiring." (<i>Steve Donoghue, Open Letters Monthly</i>)<br><br>"One of the ten best conservation and environment books of the year. . . . I especially enjoyed the lovely blend of science, journalism and travelogue." (Grrl Scientist <i>Forbes</i>)<br><br>"Just writing an entire book about a single species is an accomplishment. That it is so well done and enjoyable is a bonus." (<i>Farm and Dairy</i>)<br><br>"I'm not sure I would have believed in advance that someone could write 500 fascinating pages about a single species of rattlesnake, but Ted Levin has done just that. <i>America&#x2019;sSnake</i> is so engaging the reading borders on effortless; the writing is masterful, inspiring non-stop interest and confidence in Levin's scholarship. The book will be of interest to herpetologists and conservationists, as well as to everyone concerned with how we can live with dangerous animals.<i>"</i><br> &nbsp; (Harry Greene, author of Snakes)<br><br>"This beautifully written book demonstrates just how good nature literature can be." (Edward O. Wilson, Harvard University)<br><br>"The marriage of a great writer and a great subject is always a joy to behold. And few subjects could be more iconic, or more fascinating, than Crotalus Horridus, whose very name tells you that there's a deep story to be told here.<i>"</i><br> &nbsp; (Bill McKibben, author of Wandering Home)<br><br>"'Are you crazy?,' they kept asking. No, because Ted Levin was going to be with me as I walked among rattlesnakes placidly heading for their bouldery den-site among the fallen leaves of autumn (was I crazy?). Everything about them was surprising: their docility, their beauty--and how knowledgeably Ted loved them. His writing shows how much we can see when we open up and look, how much there is to be awed by, even in creatures we most fear. This is a deep, wise book that delivers way more than you&#x2019;d expect. You'll begin reading about a legless being almost universally dreaded and reviled. And you&#x2019;ll come away snake-charmed and enchanted by the sacred improbability of the living world." (Carl Safina, author of Beyond Words)</p><h2>The Buddha Speaks - A book of guidance from Buddhist scriptures</h2><p>Here is the core of the Buddha's teachings in his own words, as it was memorized word-for-word by his disciples and written down two hundred years after his death. These selections from the Buddhist scriptures deal with the search for truth, the way of contemplation, life, and death, living in community, and many other topics, serving as an excellent introduction to the Buddha's teaching. Whether addressed to monks and nuns, householders, outcastes, or thieves, the Buddha's teachings are characterized by one main concern: conveying the reality of our bondage to suffering&#x2014;and the supremely good news that liberation is possible. It is a concern as relevant for people today as it was for the people of north India a millenium and a half ago.</p><p>If you're looking for an introduction to Buddhism but don't want your information secondhand, <i>The Buddha Speaks</i> is the book for you. Anne Bancroft takes us right into the Buddha's own words, delivering his opinions direct from the sutras on such topics as love, mind, death, wisdom, and society. The words are wise and as relevant today as they were 2,000 years ago. On love: "A mother, even at the risk of her own life, protects her child.... In the same way should you cultivate love without measure toward all beings." On the mind: "This mind is like a fish out of water that thrashes and throws itself about, its thoughts following each of its cravings.... How good it is to control it and know the happiness of freedom." On society: "Hatred does not come to an end through hatred but can only cease through generosity." The Buddha's teachings are considered a refuge by Buddhists around the world, and <i>The Buddha Speaks</i> reconstructs this sanctuary wherever you are. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Anne Bancroft is the author of numerous books, including Zen: Direct Pointing to Reality and Weavers of Wisdom: Women Mystics of the Twentieth Century.

Lessons From a Leader on How to Turn Around a Service Business</h2><p>Singled out by Fortune and The New York Times as a remarkable manager, Dan Kaplan has pioneered a revolutionary new system for measuring service quality to help managers keep track of intangibles in a service business. Provides a straightforward, practical case study of managing for excellence along with invaluable insight into the potentials and limitations inherent in the management systems under which organizations operate.</p><p>The service sector of the U.S. economy is booming. Until recently, the number of books devoted to the management of services has been smaller than those devoted to manufacturing. These new titles are helping to change the situation. Targeting the service firm with fewer than 100 employees, the Rosses provide a how-to manual geared especially to newcomers to the service sector. They provide guidelines for such frequently encountered problems as formulating a marketing plan, motivating employees, and attracting favorable public relations. While most of the suggestions are already available in standard management libraries, these authors provide a remarkable service by assembling and distilling much of this information. Kaplan targets the larger service company. Presenting the management philosophy he developed while managing the turnaround at Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, Kaplan details the successful application of TQM principles to a service setting. His core idea is that the ultimate success results from doing thousands of little things just a bit better than the competition. Managers will love this book because it resonates with the tone of a pragmatic manager who can express his ideas in a general way that any service organization can apply. Both books will serve libraries well.<br><i>- Gene R. Laczniak, Marquette Univ., Milwaukee</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Total quality management (TQM) is the most significant managerial theory since 1980; unfortunately, its basic tenets are often obscured by numbing jargon and mathematical formulas. Kaplan, president of Hertz Equipment Rental Corp., and Rieser, a former editor at Fortune , here craft one of the best applied TQM studies to appear this season. Starting with "a set of simple methods that will enable managers to become more effective and productive," the authors describe the turnaround policies (statistical benchmarking, constantly refining service standards and building trust through commitment) employed by Kaplan at Hertz.

This sweeping and unprecedented chronicle of the economic and social connections between the two nations opens a new window onto history from the Civil War to today and brilliantly illuminates the course of events that made the United States a global empire. The Mexican Revolution, Manifest Destiny, World War II, and NAFTA are all part of the story, but John Mason Hart's narrative transcends these moments of economic and political drama, resonating with the themes of wealth and power. Combining economic and historical analysis with personal memoirs and vivid descriptions of key episodes and players, <i>Empire and Revolution </i>is based on substantial amounts of previously unexplored source material. Hart excavated recently declassified documents in the archives of the United States government and traveled extensively in rural Mexico to uncover the rich sources for this gripping story of 135 years of intervention, cooperation, and corruption.<br><br>Beginning just after the American Civil War, Hart traces the activities of an elite group of financiers and industrialists who, sensing opportunities for wealth to the south, began to develop Mexico's infrastructure. He charts their activities through the pivotal regime of Porfirio D�az, when Americans began to gain ownership of Mexico's natural resources, and through the Mexican Revolution, when Americans lost many of their holdings in Mexico. Hart concentrates less on traditional political history in the twentieth century and more on the hidden interactions between Americans and Mexicans, especially the unfolding story of industrial production in Mexico for export to the United States. Throughout, this masterful narrative illuminates the development and expansion of the American railroad, oil, mining, and banking industries. Hart also shows how the export of the "American Dream" has shaped such areas as religion and work attitudes in Mexico.<br><br><i>Empire and Revolution </i>reveals much about the American psyche, especially the compulsion of American elites toward wealth, global power, and contact with other peoples, often in order to "save" them. These characteristics were first expressed internationally in Mexico, and Hart shows that the Mexican experience was and continues to be a prototype for U.S. expansion around the world. His work demonstrates the often inconspicuous yet profoundly damaging impact of American investment in the underdeveloped countries of Latin America, Asia, and Africa. <i>Empire and Revolution </i>will be the definitive book on U.S.-Mexico relations and their local and global ramifications.</p><p>"This is an extraordinarily important history of both U.S.-Mexico relations and of the political, economic, social, and cultural activities of Americans in Mexico."&#x2014;Friedrich Katz, author of <i>The Life and Times of Pancho Villa</i><br><br>"Empire and Revolution is empowering as well as informative, providing a detailed record and judicious interpretation of the protean relations between the United States and Mexico. As John Mason Hart convincingly narrates, the association is of dynamic importance for people of both countries. While there have been studies on discrete parts and periods of the U.S.-Mexico relation, this book charts and anchors the relation globally. Hart allows the reader intellectual as well as imaginative insight into the multifaceted social, cultural, and political reality of the sharing of North America&#x2014;then, now, and in the future."&#x2014;Juan Gomez-Quinones, author of <i>Mexican-American Labor, 1790-1990</i>&#34;This is an extraordinarily important history of both U.S.-Mexico relations and of the political, economic, social, and cultural activities of Americans in Mexico.&#34;-Friedrich Katz, author of The Life and Times of Pancho Villa</p><h2>Rolling the R&#39;s</h2><p>Illuminated by pop fantasies, Donna Summer disco tracks and teen passion, the fiercely earnest characters in <i>Rolling the R&#x2019;s</i> come to life against a background of burning dreams and neglect in a small 1970s Hawaiian community. In his daring first novel, R. Zamora Linmark treats the music of the Bee Gees and schoolyard bullying as equally formative experiences in the lives of a group of Filipino fourth-graders living in Kalihi, Honolulu, who call themselves the "Farrah Fawcett Fan Club." The characters&#x2019; stories unfold largely in the documentary detritus of their lives&#x2015;their poems and prayers, book reports and teacher evaluations&#x2015;all written in carefully observed, pitch-perfect vernacular. Now back in stock, Linmark&#x2019;s tour-de-force experiments in narrative structure, pidgin and perspective roll every "are," throwing new light on gay identity and the trauma of cultural assimilation. <i>Rolling the R&#x2019;s</i> goes beyond "coming of age" and "coming out" to address the realities of cultural confusion, prejudice and spiraling levels of desire in humorous yet haunting portrayals that are, as Matthew Stadler writes, "stylish, shameless and beautiful." This special twentieth anniversary edition includes a new essay by the author, introducing one of the most original and iconic stories of the Asian diasporic experience and an essential work of fiction in the Asian American literary canon. <br><b>R. Zamora Linmark</b> (born 1968) is a writer and poet currently based in Honolulu and Manila. He has published three poetry collections, two novels and adapted <i>Rolling the R&#x2019;s</i> for the stage in 2008.</p><p>R. Zamora Linmark is the author of two novels, LECHE (Coffee House Press, 2011) and ROLLING THE R&#39;s (Kaya Press, 1997), and two poetry collections, PRIME TIME APPARITIONS (Hanging Loose Press, 2005) and THE EVOLUTION OF A SIGH (Hanging Loose Press, 2008).

Popularly known as <em>The Art of War, Sun-Tzu</em> is one of the leading books on strategic thinking ever written. While other books on strategy, wisdom, and philosophy come and go, both leaders and gentle contemplators alike have embraced the writings of Sun-tzu.</p><p><em>Sun-Tzu</em> is not simply another of many translations already available, but an entirely new text, based on manuscripts recently discovered in Linyi, China, that predates all previous texts by as much as one thousand years. In translating the text, researcher and interpreter J. H. Huang traced the roots of the language to before 221 B.C. to get to the original intent; Besides offering a wonderfully clear translation, Huang adds an introduction to the history behind <em>Sun-Tzu</em> and his own comments on the meaning of the text. In addition, <em>Sun-Tzu</em> includes six appendices, five of which were uncovered at Linyi and are not found in other editions.</p>The writings of Sun-tzu have stood the test of time, and J. H.

Entries are arranged in a way that distinguishes between words that are close synonyms and words that differ somewhat in meaning or usage. More than 150 full-color photographs illustrate the many example sentences and make this book as attractive as it is useful. As an added bonus, this updated edition includes an explanation of the major parts of speech, to help young writers establish a firm grasp of language.</p><p>Is this a conventional thesaurus? Regular and standard? Or would you say it was more extraordinary--exceptional and outstanding? Paul Hellweg's <i>The American Heritage Children's Thesaurus</i> is both, actually. It provides everything you'd expect from a children's thesaurus--4,000 words with over 36,000 synonyms--but it is unusually clear and colorfully presented. Each deep purple entry includes its part of speech in italics, and lists the suggested synonyms in bold, best matches first. Each word is used in a sentence to clarify its meaning. Color photographs are sprinkled throughout for visual relief, and "Antonyms" and "Word Groups" boxes help expand vocabulary choices. Word groups are reserved for words like "international," which doesn't have a real synonym but a cluster of closely related words such as "communal, global, national, planetary, universal," and "worldwide." If your favorite students tend to overuse words like "nice," "funny," and "weird" (and who doesn't, really?), this handy reference will have them turning a phrase with finesse.

Photographs taken by this celebrated group, whose ranks included Dorothea Lange, Ben Shahn, Gordon Parks, Russell Lee and Walker Evans, have since become icons of the 1930s and 1940s. In recent years, however, their work has been reproduced with little discussion of the particular circumstances surrounding its creation.<br><br><i>Documenting America</i> takes a fresh look at these remarkable photographs. The book opens with two incisive essays by Lawrence Levine and Alan Trachtenberg that examine issues central to photography and American culture. While Levine explains how the pictures portray the complexity of life in the period, balancing scenes of Depression hard times with images of the pleasures of life, Trachtenberg analyzes the way in which viewers read photographs and the role of the government picture file that stands between the creation of the photographs and their use. Both essayists raise important questions about Stryker's grand ambition of a photographic record of America, about the "ways of seeing" that have grown up around the most famous of these photographs, and about the whole enterprise of documentary photography and the conventions of realism.<br><br>The images themselves are presented in series selected from groups of pictures created by single photographers. A documentary photographer often makes dozens of exposures to portray different elements of the subject, experiment with camera angles, and cover the stages of an event or steps of a process. By studying these pictures in series, we come closer to the photographer working in the field. We see a tenant farming community in Gee's Bend, Georgia, the activities of the Salvation Army in San Francisco, and the hubbub and commotion that filled Chicago's Union Railway Station in 1943. Texts accompanying each of the book's fifteen series describe the circumstances that gave rise to the creation of the pictures and discuss the relation between government policy and the subjects of the photographs. The nearly three hundred images included vividly portray America in the last bitter years of the Great Depression and the first years of the Second World War.</p><p>This book presents fifteen case histories-- photographic series accompanied by texts summarizing information about the photographers, their work in the field, and their assignments and subjects.<b>Carl Fleischhauer</b> is a Folklife Specialist and <b>Beverly Brannan</b> is a Curator of Photography, both at the Library of Congress. <b>Lawrence W.

But by the end of the nineteenth century, Zayas had been excluded from the Spanish literary canon because of her gender and the sociopolitical changes that swept Spain and Europe. <i>Exemplary Tales of Love and Tales of Disillusion</i> gathers a representative sample of seven stories, which features Zayas&#x2019;s signature topics&#x2014;gender equality and domestic violence&#x2014;written in an impassioned tone overlaid with conservative Counter-Reformation ideology. This edition updates the scholarship since the most recent English translations, with a new introduction to Zayas&#x2019;s entire body of stories, and restores Zayas&#x2019;s author&#x2019;s note and prologue, omitted from previous English-language editions. Tracing her slow but steady progress from notions of ideal love to love&#x2019;s treachery, <i>Exemplary Tales of Love and Tales of Disillusion</i> will restore Zayas to her rightful place in modern letters.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p></p></p><p><b>Margaret R.

Yet the evidence shows that AA has only a 5&#x2013;10 percent success rate&#x2014;hardly better than no treatment at all. Despite this, doctors, employers, and judges regularly refer addicted people to treatment programs and rehab facilities based on the 12-step model.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Sober Truth</i>, acclaimed addiction specialist Dr. Lance Dodes exposes the deeply flawed science that the 12-step industry has used to support its programs. Dr. Dodes analyzes dozens of studies to reveal a startling pattern of errors, misjudgments, and biases. He also pores over the research to highlight the best peer-reviewed studies available and discovers that they reach a grim consensus on the program&#x2019;s overall success.<br> &nbsp;<br> But<i> The Sober Truth</i> is more than a book about addiction. It is also a book about science and how and why AA and rehab became so popular, despite the discouraging data. Dr. Dodes explores the entire story of AA&#x2019;s rise, from its origins in early fundamentalist religious and mystical beliefs to its present-day place of privilege in politics and media. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Sober Truth</i> includes true stories from Dr. Dodes&#x2019;s thirty-five years of clinical practice, as well as firsthand accounts submitted by addicts through an open invitation on the <i>Psychology Today</i> website. These stories vividly reveal the experience of walking the steps and attending some of the nation&#x2019;s most famous rehabilitation centers. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Sober Truth</i> builds a powerful response to the monopoly of the 12-step program and explodes the myth that these programs offer an acceptable or universal solution to the deeply personal problem of addiction.

Today&nbsp;few areas of public health are more riven with unsubstantiated&nbsp;claims than the field of addiction. <br><br>Alcoholics Anonymous has been instrumental in the widespread&nbsp;adoption of many such myths. The organization&#x2019;s Twelve Steps, its expressions,&nbsp;and unique lexicon have found their way into the public discourse&nbsp;in a way that few other &#x201c;brands&#x201d; could ever match. So ingrained&nbsp;are these ideas, in fact, that many Americans would be hard-pressed to&nbsp;identify which came from AA and which from scientific investigation.<br><br>The unfortunate part of this cultural penetration is that many addiction&nbsp;myths are <br>harmful or even destructive, perpetuating false ideas&nbsp;about who addicts are, what addiction is, and what is needed to quit for&nbsp;good. In this chapter, I&#x2019;d like to take a look at a few of these myths and&nbsp;examine some of the ways they impair efforts at adopting a more effective&nbsp;approach.<br><br>MYTH #1: YOU HAVE TO &#x201c;HIT BOTTOM&#x201d;&nbsp;BEFORE YOU CAN GET WELL<br><br> This common myth essentially says that an addict needs to reach a point&nbsp;of absolute loss or despair before he or she can begin to climb back toward&nbsp;a safe and productive life.<br><br>The most common objection to this myth is simple logic: nobody&nbsp;can possibly know where their &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; is until they identify it in retrospect.&nbsp;One person&#x2019;s lowest point could be a night on the street, while another&#x2019;s&nbsp;could be a bad day at work or even a small personal humiliation.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s not unusual for one &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; to make way for another following a&nbsp;relapse. Without a clear definition, this is a concept that could be useful&nbsp;only in hindsight, if it is useful at all.<br><br>A bigger problem with this notion is the idea that addiction is in&nbsp;some fundamental way just a matter of stubbornness or stupidity&#x2014;&nbsp;that is, addicts cannot recover until they are shown the consequences&nbsp;of their actions in a forceful enough way. This is a dressed-up version&nbsp;of the idea that addiction is a conscious choice and that stopping is a&nbsp;matter of recognizing the damage it causes. I have said it before, but it&nbsp;bears repeating: if consequences alone were enough to make someone&nbsp;stop repeating an addictive behavior, there would be no addicts. One&nbsp;of the defining agonies of addiction is that people can&#x2019;t stop despite&nbsp;being well aware of the devastating consequences. That millions of&nbsp;people who have lost their jobs, marriages, and families are still unable&nbsp;to quit should be a clear indication that loss and despair, even&nbsp;in overwhelming quantities, aren&#x2019;t enough to cure addiction. Conversely,&nbsp;many addicts stop their behavior at a point where they have&nbsp;not hit bottom in any sense.<br><br>There is a moralistic subtext at work here as well. The notion that&nbsp;addicts have to hit bottom suggests that they are too selfish to quit until&nbsp;they have paid a steep enough personal price. Once again we get an echo&nbsp;of the medieval notion of penance here: through suffering comes purity.&nbsp;Addicts no more need to experience devastating personal loss than does&nbsp;anyone else with a problem. Yes, it can be useful when a single moment&nbsp;helps to crystallize that one <i>has </i>a problem, but the fantasy that this moment&nbsp;must be especially painful is simply nonsensical.<br><br>Finally, the dogmatic insistence that addicts hit bottom is often&nbsp;used to excuse poor treatment. Treaters who are unable to help often&nbsp;scold addicts by telling them that they just aren&#x2019;t ready yet and that they&nbsp;should come back once they&#x2019;ve hit bottom and become ready to do the&nbsp;work. This is little more than a convenient dodge for ineffectual care,&nbsp;and a needless burden to place on the shoulders of addicts.<br><br>MYTH #2: YOU MUST &#x201c;SURRENDER&#x201d; YOUR WILL TO GET WELL<br><br>Here we have another pillar of the Oxford Group, AA&#x2019;s theological&nbsp;forerunner, which preached salvation through surrender to God. In&nbsp;<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, this idea is implied, if not expressly stated, in&nbsp;steps 1 and 3, which respectively recommend admitting powerlessness&nbsp;and making a decision &#x201c;to turn our will and our lives over to the care of&nbsp;God as we understood God.&#x201d;<br><br>The first problem with this idea is its overt religious flavor. I have&nbsp;covered the many ways that addiction is a problem of the mind and not&nbsp;of the spiritual soul. &#x201c;Surrendering,&#x201d; in the sense that addiction organizations&nbsp;commonly understand it, means abdicating power to a presence&nbsp;greater than oneself to attain guidance. It&#x2019;s not surprising that many&nbsp;addicts chafe at this notion, not least because it requires a belief system&nbsp;that may not jibe with their own.<br><br>A bigger problem is that surrendering is tantamount to agreeing&nbsp;that one is incapable of managing one&#x2019;s own life. AA&#x2019;s literature ties this&nbsp;idea once again to a moralistic adage: &#x201c;Our whole trouble had been the&nbsp;misuse of will power.&#x201d;1 Surrendering becomes a way to toss out a useful&nbsp;sense of selfhood or agency precisely when it&#x2019;s needed most.<br><br>And of course the very notion of surrender is problematic when&nbsp;viewed through the prism of a more psychologically sophisticated understanding&nbsp;of addiction. As I outlined in chapter 5, the emotion that&nbsp;precipitates addiction is <i>helplessness. </i>Addicts find certain forms of helplessness&nbsp;utterly intolerable, and the addiction is an effort to reverse that.&nbsp;Asking them to surrender their free will in response to this problem is&nbsp;diametrically opposed to what they need to do: feel empowered. As we&nbsp;saw in the first-person accounts in chapter 6, the dissonance created by&nbsp;this emphasis on surrender is one of the big reasons so many addicts&nbsp;don&#x2019;t get better in AA.</p><h2>Friendship - Member Book: Transform Through Strong Relationships</h2><p><p><b>Friendship: Transform Through Strong Relationships - Member Book</b> is an 8 session men's Bible study by <b>Kenny Luck</b>. God&#x2019;s Word is clear about the importance of godly friendships &#x2015; and how God designs them to complete us spiritually. If you ever hope to win the battles you face in your spiritual journey, you must be connected to godly men. The problem is that many men today act as if they don&#x2019;t need friends &#x2015; and they&#x2019;re paying the price. Risking relationships is not easy for men, but it&#x2019;s non-negotiable for God&#x2019;s man. When you stand with others who share your spiritual goals, you achieve them faster. That&#x2019;s God&#x2019;s way. Godly friendships create consistency, provide care and support, stimulate healthy confession, produce new connections, and make you complete in Christ. They produce positive changes in your character, convictions, conduct, and commitment to do life God&#x2019;s way.</p><p><b>Features:</b></p><ul><li>Video-driven Bible study</li><li>8 group sessions</li><li>A Get Healthy study (from the Sleeping Giant ministry strategy)</li></ul><p><b>Benefits:</b></p><ul><li>Learn how to build and benefit from friendships with godly men.</li><li>Practical studies&#x2015;for individual use or group settings&#x2015;facilitate personal encounters with God and other men</li><li>Ideal for existing men's groups or new ones emerging from ongoing ministry such as Men's Fraternity</li><li>Counters the effects of isolation in the lives of men</li><li>Helps men in the crucial area of building strong relationships&#x2015;an area of deficiency for many men</li></ul><p><b>Author:</b><br> Kenny Luck is president and founder of Every Man Ministries, author of Sleeping Giant, and coauthor of the best selling Every Man, God&#x2019;s Man.

Her bearing, patrician and aloof, invited respect and deference. She stood ramrod straight like a caryatid and yet glided fluidly about like a gently moving stream. Her face -- smooth, unlined, handsomely tanned -- radiated upper-class hauteur. But behind her dreamy eyes and raspy voice -- the result of years of smoking -- lurked a fragile soul. </p><p> There was a deep wound somewhere inside. I'll never know whether it was some personal tragedy or betrayal, for my grandmother was hardly one to confide in others. For her, acknowledging one's private pain in public was unacceptable, and she jealously guarded hers behind a veil of imagined diffidence. But the long, sleepless nights she endured spoke volumes about her inner turmoil. </p><p> Growing up, I never saw Grandmother sleep. Every evening, as we were getting ready for bed, she would stay by herself at the long kitchen table and absentmindedly shuffle her cards. In the morning, I'd find her in the same place, sitting in front of her cards, as though she'd hardly moved all night. </p><p> Intrigued by her "mania" -- a word used by other members of the family to describe her behavior -- I approached Grandmother one evening and quietly asked her why she always played cards alone. Instead of a direct answer, she taught me <i>Clairvoyance</i>, a children's game that involved predicting the color of the cards about to be turned up. It was love at first sight for both of us. Seeing my determination to beat the odds, Grandmother knew at once that I it took to be a persistent player. At last, she had found an avid student. </p><p> Soon the two of us played together almost daily. Grandmother taught me as many games as I could fathom and let me practice them with her, correcting my mistakes as they occurred and tapping on my fingers gently each time I attempted an "illegal" move. </p><p> One day she allowed me into her room. There, she lifted a little cedar box from a drawer, ceremoniously opened it and fished out an old deck of cards that were dog-eared and discolored. Yet, Grandmother held up the cards as if they were holy relics on display before an assembly of believers. She had inherited the cards from her own grandmother, she said, and had been preserving them as if they were sacred. </p><p><b> The Origin of Playing Cards </b></p> <p> "Who invented playing cards?" I once asked her, and she treated me to a story. Hundreds of years ago in China, she said, most mandarins forbade their concubines to work lest it harm their physical beauty. The idle concubines, poor things, grew so desperately bored that the mandarins had to call upon a Chinese sage for help. The latter obliged by inventing playing cards as a pastime for the concubines. The great explorer Marco Polo eventually brought the cards back to Venice and, in time, the Venetians introduced them to Europe. Grandmother added that some people believed that playing cards had originated in India, where they were invented by a maharajas wife to discourage her husband from playing with his beard. </p><p> I burst out laughing and told Grandmother I didn't believe a word of it. After a long silence, she said in that cigarette-strained rasp: "Ah! The things one invents just to counter boredom!" </p><p><b> Pictorial Symbols </b></p> <p> One day, Grandmother decided to describe to me what playing cards actually represented. "They have always had four suits," she explained. "In the old days, these were a coin, a cup, a sword and a stick. The suits evolved as the cards gained popularity in Europe. The Germans opted for a leaf, a tassel, a bell and a heart. And it was the French who gave the cards their current suits, which originally symbolized the four social classes. Hearts represented the church; spades, the army; diamonds, the bourgeoisie; and clubs, the peasantry. </p><p> "For me, though, cards are a mirror of the human race," Grandmother added. "Hearts represent the lovers' race -- people who are tall, attractive and impeccably groomed; they are happy, gregarious and generous. Spades represent sinister-looking criminals with black, bulging eyes and shaggy, grimy hair. Diamonds represent dreamers, like poets and artists -- sensitive, whimsical people with slim, lithe and gracious bodies. Clubs represent the peasantry: narrow-minded, indolent and tenacious individuals. They are thick, heavy-set and muscular, with shiny, unkempt hair." </p><p> Watching Grandmother manipulate the cards, I sensed that she was also rearranging the story of her own life -- the triumphs as well as the heartbreaks. </p><p><b> Playing Cards and the Calendar Year </b></p> <p> Grandmother was so struck by the eerie affinity between a pack of cards and the calendar year that she often wondered whether or not some ancient astrologer had actually invented them. She pointed out that a deck contains 52 cards, just like a year has 52 weeks; the colors -- red and black -- correspond with the two yearly solstices; their 12 figures match the 12 zodiac signs; and there are four suits -- hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs -- just as there are four seasons. The 13 cards that make up each suit correspond with the 13 weeks in a season, or the 13 months -- of 28 days each -- in a lunar year. Since the ace is worth one point, the jack 11, the queen 12 and the king 13, the sum of all the cards in a suit is 91, which is also the number of days in a season. What's more, if you add up all four suits, you'll get a total of 364, which is the number of days in a year (52 weeks x 7 days, or, in the case of the lunar year, 13 months x 28 days). </p><p> Grandmother believed that the joker was added to the deck to fulfill the role of the 365th day in a leap year. Come to think of it, the joker does not really belong anywhere -- not with the hearts, nor the spades, diamonds or clubs. He doesn't even have a figure -- he is neither king, nor queen, nor jack -- and has no rank. Withdraw the joker from the deck and it remains whole. Yet, introduce him in a game and at once he starts commanding it, dominating all the assets and outclassing all ranks. In Grandmother's mind, the advent of the joker must have been the work of a cheat. </p><p><b> Solitaire Games </b></p> <p> There are two kinds of card games: </p><ul> <li>the plastic game, or tarot, which originated in Italy and is based on images. </li><li>the numerical game, which originated in Asia; it is based on rank and consists of one numerical sequence per suit. </li></ul> <p> Solitaire belongs in the numerical-game category, which can be broken down further into two categories: one is based on rank, such as in <i>Battle</i>, whereby the higher number prevails; the other is based on combination, whereby the player tries to put combinations together that will yield the greatest value. Poker is the best known of combination games. </p><p> According to Grandmother, solitaire is a game to be played alone and to say that it requires two or more players is utter nonsense. It is the most popular of all card games, and there are more varieties than all other forms of card games combined. Experts believe there are at least 350 different games of solitaire, and new ones are being invented all the time. </p><p> Blessed with an extraordinary intelligence and a fabulous memory, Grandmother was a high-caliber solitaire player. She knew more than a hundred games by heart. She had written out about 200 games in her notebook: some she had learned from her maternal grandmother and some from acquaintances; others she had picked up from old books or by corresponding with her parents and friends. Grandmother had even invented a few games. She was so proud of one particular game, Germaine, that she named it after herself. Unfortunately, I was unable to find her notebook; I assumed she burned it shortly before she died. </p><p> Most games of solitaire require a mixture of luck and skill. Rare are those that are designed to "come out" either through pure chance or by skill alone.

Historians increasingly feel the need to weigh in on popular depictions of the past, since so much of the public's knowledge of history comes from popular mediums. Aberth dissects how each film interpreted the period, offering estimations of the historical accuracy of the works and demonstrating how they project their own contemporary era's obsessions and fears onto the past.</p><p><strong>John Aberth</strong>received his Ph.D. in medieval history from Cambridge University in England and teaches history at several colleges in Vermont. He is author of <em>From the</em> <em>Brink of the Apocalypse: Confronting Famine, War, Plague,</em> <em>and Death in the Later Middle Ages</em> , also published by Routledge."This is an ambitious and exciting book. The author combines very up-to-date historiography -- some of it controversial but all of it interesting -- with a sensitive and deep appreciation of the art of the films. Any teacher of film or medieval studies should make use of this valuable resource."<br>-Jeremy duQuesnay Adams, Southern Methodist University <br></p><h2>1897 Sears Roebuck &amp; Co Catalogue</h2><p>A reprint of the popular mail-order catalogue provides an authentic picture of American domestic life at the close of the century.</p><p><b>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.</b> was founded in 1886 in Chicago, Illinois.

Mounira M. Charrad analyzes the distinctive nature of Islamic legal codes by placing them in the larger context of state power in various societies. <br><br>Charrad argues that many analysts miss what is going on in Islamic societies because they fail to recognize the logic of the kin-based model of social and political life, which she contrasts with the Western class-centered model. In a skillful synthesis, she shows how the logic of Islamic legal codes and kin-based political power affect the position of women. These provide the key to Charrad's empirical puzzle: why, after colonial rule, women in Tunisia gained broad legal rights (even in the absence of a feminist protest movement) while, despite similarities in culture and religion, women remained subordinated in post-independence Morocco and Algeria. Charrad's elegant theory, crisp writing, and solid scholarship make a unique contribution in developing a state-building paradigm to discuss women's rights.<br><br>This book will interest readers in the fields of sociology, politics, law, women's studies, postcolonial studies, Middle Eastern studies, Middle Eastern history, French history, and Maghrib studies.</p><p>"Brilliantly conceptualized and thoroughly researched, Mounira Charrad's book breaks important new ground in the explanation of legal changes affecting women's rights. We learn why apparently similar countries have taken very different paths. This book is a 'must read' not only for students of North Africa, but for everyone interested in the impact of nation-building and state policies on gender relations."&#x2015;Theda Skocpol, author of <i>States and Social Revolutions</i> <br><br>"Theoretically powerful and historically rich, this is an important study in comparative political sociology. Using the comparative method at its best to make a provocative argument about kin-based politics, Charrad gives us a new way of looking at state-building strategies."&#x2015;Seymour M. Lipset, author of <i>Political Man</i><br><br>"In a stunning scholarly achievement, Charrad identifies the links between Islamic legal codes, kin-based political power and the subordination of women. She traces the inner logic of political systems, showing how the different bases on which nations are built have very different implications for the rights of women."&#x2015;Ann Swidler, author of <i>Talk of Love: How Culture Matters</i> <br><br>"Charrad adds a new dimension to the consideration of women's rights and state formation not only in the Middle East, but throughout the world. In a rigorous comparative analysis of the origins and development of women's rights in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, she demonstrates how history and politics shape family law."&#x2015;Elizabeth W. Fernea, author of <i>In Search of Islamic Feminism </i><br><br>"Necessary reading for those who wish to understand the role of state formation and cultural identity in diverse patterns of Muslim family law reform, a legacy which continues to impact contemporary Muslim politics."&#x2015;John Esposito, author of <i>Islam and Politics </i><br><br>"Charrad has offered one of the most systematic and insightful comparative analyses of the relationships between family systems, family law, and state. That the 'personal is political' becomes very concrete as she persuasively demonstrates that family relations are inseparable from state politics."&#x2015;Suad Joseph, editor of <i>Citizenship and Gender in the Middle East</i> <br><br>"Dr. Charrad's convincingly argued and meticulously researched book raises the bar of comparative studies of gender and the State, while making a unique contribution to knowledge about the rights and status of Muslim women in general and of the women of the Maghrib in particular."&#x2015;Rae Blumberg, author of <i>Engendering Wealth and Well-being </i> <br><br>"A new interpretation that will change the way we think about women's status and family law in North Africa."&#x2015;Nancy Gallagher, author of <i>Approaches to the History of the Middle East</i> <br><br>"Charrad's book is a wonderful example of the strength of the comparative method . . .

In the course of two expeditions that consumed most of his adult life-and eventually led to his death-he journeyed from St. Petersburg to Siberia and ultimately to the northwest coast of America. Along with the members of his expedition (thousands participated in the second expedition), Bering greatly expanded the Russian empire, pioneered the geography of the North Pacific Ocean, and laid the groundwork for Russian trade and settlement in the American West. In the first biography of Bering written in over a century, Orcutt Frost chronicles the life of this extraordinary explorer. Drawing on a wide range of new evidence-including personal letters and archaeological evidence derived from the recent discovery of Bering&#39;s grave site-the author reconstructs Bering&#39;s personality, his perilous voyages, and his uneasy relationship with the naturalist Georg Steller, who unobtrusively guided the stranded expedition as Bering lay dying. A riveting narrative of adventure and disaster on the high seas, this biography is also a major contribution to the history of maritime exploration.</p><p>&#34;A biography of Bering has long been needed and no one is better suited to write it than Orcutt Frost. Based on meticulous scholarship and a lifelong knowledge of the subject, this biography will be a revelation to anyone interested in the history of exploration.&#34;-Glyn Williams, author of Voyages of Delusion: The Quest for the Northwest PassageOrcutt Frost, emeritus professor of the humanities at Alaska Pacific University, is an authority on Bering&#39;s voyages and has written numerous books and articles on the subject.</p><h2>Temple Mysticism</h2><p>According to Margaret Barker, temple mysticism underpins much of the Bible.

Boyer is the only history of the United States&#39; territory covering the period from 1492 to 2010. Especially emphasized is the period since 1917 when the U.S. acquired the Islands from Denmark. Constituting three small Caribbean islands St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John each is unique, but together they are widely known as a favorite tourist destination featuring sun, sand and surf. In many respects, the territory is a microcosm of the human family. The diversity of its physical environment is matched by the diversity of its people. The focal point of the book is a record of the struggle of the Islanders&#39; greater number as slaves, then serfs, and lastly as citizens to gain control of their own destiny. Broadly conceived, this is a history of human rights and human wrongs. The author does not merely portray the history of the Islands and their people; he also shows how the Islanders share the same aspirations as other colonial subjects. In so doing he taps previously unused sources. The relationship between the USA and the Virgin Islands has been marked by indifference and vacillation on the part of American officials. Moreover, thousands of tourists who flock to the territory annually are unaware of the Islands checkered and rich history. For many, the Islands are simply a tropical paradise. America&#39;s Virgin Islands is a fascinating, extensively documented, and detailed source of information, valuable to those interested in a political and cultural perspective, to those interested in African American or Caribbean history, and likewise to those who live in or visit the Islands.</p><p>Dr. William W.

Millions of Europeans journeyed to the United States in the peak years of 1892&#x2013;1924, and Ellis Island, New York, is where the great majority landed. Ellis Island opened in 1892 with the goal of placing immigration under the control of the federal government and systematizing the entry process. <i>Encountering Ellis Island</i> introduces readers to the ways in which the principal nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American portal for Europeans worked in practice, with some comparison to Angel Island, the main entry point for Asian immigrants. </p><p>What happened along the journey? How did the processing of so many people work? What were the reactions of the newly arrived to the process (and threats) of inspection, delays, hospitalization, detention, and deportation? How did immigration officials attempt to protect the country from diseased or "unfit" newcomers, and how did these definitions take shape and change? What happened to people who failed screening? And how, at the journey's end, did immigrants respond to admission to their new homeland?</p><p>Ronald H. Bayor, a senior scholar in immigrant and urban studies, gives voice to both immigrants and Island workers to offer perspectives on the human experience and institutional imperatives associated with the arrival experience. Drawing on firsthand accounts from, and interviews with, immigrants, doctors, inspectors, aid workers, and interpreters, Bayor paints a vivid and sometimes troubling portrait of the immigration process. </p><p>In reality, Ellis Island had many liabilities as well as assets. Corruption was rife. Immigrants with medical issues occasionally faced a hostile staff. Some families, on the other hand, reunited in great joy and found relief at their journey's end. </p><p><i>Encountering Ellis Island</i> lays bare the profound and sometimes-victorious story of people chasing the American Dream: leaving everything behind, facing a new language and a new culture, and starting a new American life.</p></p><p><p>A look at the process of entering America a hundred years ago&#x2015;from both an institutional and a human perspective.</p><p><b>Ronald H.

First, it presents a holistic view of sociocultural systems, and secondly, the book provides a unified theoretical framework for explaining these systems. It also remains faithful to the belief that anthropologists must routinely deal with facts and theories that are crucial to informed decisions regarding issues of enduring relevance. The cultural approach used throughout furnishes a framework for explaining how the parts of sociocultural systems are interrelated and how they change over time.<p>The book also continues in its effort to identify the many causal strands that help explain the process of sociocultural change. It tries to make sense of the many seemingly irrational or arbitrary customs and institutions in small, technologically simple societies as well as complex nations.</p><p>For anyone interested in the study of culture.</p></p><h2>Music of the Baroque</h2><p>An ideal instructional package for courses in music history and literature, <em>Music of the Baroque</em> and its accompanying anthology of scores offer a lively and detailed introduction to European music from 1600 through 1750.

The previous English translation, by J. Sibree, first appeared in 1857 and was based on the defective German edition of Karl Hegel, to which Hoffmeister&#39;s edition added a large amount of new material previously unknown to English readers, derived from earlier editors. In the introduction to his lectures, Hegel lays down the principles and aims which underlie his philosophy of history, and provides an outline of the philosophy of history itself. The comprehensive and voluminous survey of world history which followed the introduction in the original lectures is of less interest to students of Hegel&#39;s thought than the introduction, and is therefore not included in this volume.</p><p>Based directly on the standard German edition by Johannes Hoffmeister, this translation presents Hegel&#39;s vision of history in a lucid, accessible form that captures the nuances of his thought.This translation provides for the first time a reliable English version of that portion of Hegel&#39;s work which Hegel himself seems to have regarded as a popular introduction to his philosophy as a whole, and which remains the most readable and accessible of all his philosophical writings.</p><h2>Mosby&#39;s Diagnostic and Laboratory Test Reference</h2><p><p>Gain quick access to today's most important diagnostic tests and procedures with <b>Mosby's Diagnostic &amp; Laboratory Test Reference, 13th Edition!</b> In this bestselling handbook, concise test entries are arranged alphabetically and reflect the latest in diagnostic testing and research.

Each conquest carried with it extensive political and social changes. Alfred began the work of creating a unified kingdom out of the shambles of the smaller kingdoms that had fallen under Viking raids. The ninth and tenth centuries saw the settlement of the Danes and the eleventh the emergence of a strong monarchy under the Danish King Cnut. "With the English kingdom grew up the first semblance of national institutions," writes Professor Brooks--institutions of central and local government which made the English monarchy among the most mature in the Europe of its time.... These established institutions were not destroyed by the Normans; they adapted and developed them.</p><p>Although England had had close ties with the continent before the Conquest, after 1066 English cultural and social life was greatly enriched through the French influence. During this time the Church was finding new inspiration in monastic and papal reform and a great intellectual revival culminated in the creation of universities. Professor Brooke describes all the cultural and political developments of these years and shows how the reign of Henry III ushered in a "great age of art and architecture" and a "new attitude to government," which began to work by consent of the governed.</p></p><p>The 400 years covered by this volume saw two Danish invasions and the Norman Conquest of England. Each conquest carried with it extensive political and social changes.</p><h2>The Examinations of Anne Askew (Women Writers in English 1350-1850)</h2><p>In this vivid first-person narrative, Anne Askew (1521-1546), a member of the Reformed church, records her imprisonment for heresy and her interrogation by officials of church and state in the last days of Henry VIII. She represents herself arguing forcefully, learnedly, and wittingly with her accusers, continually demonstrating their theological errors and her own refusal to be the traditional silent woman in public debate on religion. As a spiritual autobiography, a historical document, and a carefully crafted polemic, this work gives new insight into Reformation politics and society in England. After Askew was burned at the stake in 1546, her work was immediately published by John Bale who wove his own historical commentary with her text to "elucidate" her role as a Protestant martyr. Askew's work also exists in several early editions without Bale's commentary, most importantly in John Foxe's <em>Acts and Monuments</em> (1563).<br> <br>This volume includes two texts: the first edition of Askew's <em>Examinations</em> with Bale's <em>Elucidation</em>, and Foxe's edition uninterrupted version of her work. This book will have strong appeal for scholars and students of English Renaissance literature, Reformation history, and women's history.<br></p><p>This volume includes two texts: the first edition of Askew&#39;s Examinations with Bale&#39;s Elucidation; and Foxe&#39;s edition, an uninterrupted version of her work.

The chapters may be read independently of one another, but when read in order, they tell a more or less continuous story. We begin with some reflections on the life of Socrates and then go on to the existence of God, which is the most basic philosophical question, because our answer to it affects everything else. This leads naturally to a discussion of death and the soul, and then to more modern ideas about the nature of persons. The later chapters are about whether we can have objective knowledge in either science or ethics." -from the Preface <p> <i>Problems from Philosophy</i> represents the final work of author and philosopher James Rachels. In it, he brings the same liveliness and clarity to the introduction of philosophy that he brings to his best-selling ethics text, <i>The Elements of Moral Philosophy</i>. This second edition has been revised by Rachels' son Stuart, who carefully has carefully refined his father's work to further strengthen its clarity and accessibility.</p></p><p>James Rachels, the distinguished American moral philosopher, was born in Columbus, Georgia, graduating from Mercer University in Macon in 1962. He received his Ph.D. in 1967 from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He taught at the University of Richmond, New York University, the University of Miami, Duke University, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he spent the last twenty-six years of his career. 1971 saw the publication of Rachels&#x2019; groundbreaking textbook Moral Problems, which ignited the movement in America away from teaching ethical theory towards teaching concrete practical issues. Moral Problems sold 100,000 copies over three editions. In 1975, Rachels wrote &#x201c;Active and Passive Euthanasia,&#x201d; arguing that the distinction so important in the law between killing and letting die has no rational basis. Originally appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine, this essay has been reprinted roughly 300 times and is a staple of undergraduate education. The End of Life (1986) was about the morality of killing and the value of life. Created from Animals (1990) argued that a Darwinian world-view has widespread philosophical implications, including drastic implications for our treatment of nonhuman animals. Can Ethics Provide Answers? (1997) was Rachels&#x2019; first collection of papers (others are expected posthumously). Rachels&#x2019; McGraw-Hill textbook, The Elements of Moral Philosophy, is now in its fourth edition and is easily the best-selling book of its kind. Over his career, Rachels wrote 5 books and 85 essays, edited 7 books and gave about 275 professional lectures. His work has been translated into Dutch, Italian, Japanese, and Serbo-Croatian. James Rachels is widely admired as a stylist, as his prose is remarkably free of jargon and clutter. A major theme in his work is that reason can resolve difficult moral issues. He has given reasons for moral vegetarianism and animal rights, for affirmative action (including quotas), for the humanitarian use of euthanasia, and for the idea that parents owe as much moral consideration to other people&#x2019;s children as they do to their own. James Rachels died of cancer on September 5th, 2003, in Birmingham, Alabama.</p><h2>Galactic Dynamics (Princeton Series in Astrophysics)</h2><p><p>Two of the world's leading astrophysicists, James Binney and Scott Tremaine, here present a comprehensive review of the theory of galactic dynamics at a level suitable for both graduate students and researchers.

Praised for its modern approach, as well as for the rigor and exemplary clarity with which the authors handle the material in this book, <i>Galactic Dynamics</i> includes classic results and data while also reflecting the many recent developments in the field. The authors maintain an effective style of exposition throughout, keeping clear what is present knowledge and what is still speculation, while allowing the reader to grasp an overview of the subject before following through (where needed) with the mathematical detail. Most of the astronomical community since the late 1980s was introduced to galactic dynamics through <i>Galactic Dynamics</i>, and it remains the most widely used graduate textbook in galactic astrophysics today. No other book gathers together and presents our current understanding of the field in such a clear and concise way. Through this approach, Binney and Tremaine succeeded in creating a classic reference of enormous pedagogic value.</p></p><p><p>"Henceforth, one must have a copy of Binney and Tremaine's classic in order to do astrophysics. . . .

A serious attempt to understand the meaning of the Communist experience has not been undertaken, and millions of victims of Soviet Communism are all but forgotten. In this book David Satter, a former Moscow correspondent and longtime writer on Russia and the Soviet Union, presents a striking new interpretation of Russia's great historical tragedy, locating its source in Russia's failure fully to appreciate the value of the individual in comparison with the objectives of the state.&nbsp;</p><p>Satter explores the moral and spiritual crisis of Russian society. He shows how it is possible for a government to deny the inherent value of its citizens and for the population to agree, and why so many Russians actually mourn the passing of the Soviet regime that denied them fundamental rights.

When an animal, insect, bird, or other creature from nature appears repetitively, whether in real life or dreams, it is time to pay attention and find the message that nature is bringing you. There are many teachings available to us through the observation of a particular animal totem and their habits and patterns. For example, parrot medicine can teach us to see life from another perspective as we mimic the wise ones who have walked on the path before us. Mouse medicine teaches us to scrutinize all the details before taking action. Bear may teach you to go within yourself to find answers within your personal cave. Every animal is an ally, and every animal has a story to help you find inner peace, knowledge, and wisdom. <br><br>The associated gemstone for each animal totem is a further indication of the energy of the animal as symbolism and a teaching on your sacred journey. Crystals, minerals, and stones hold the history of the Earth and all this planet has to offer you to evolve your soul and spirit in this incarnation. The color, formation, and the manner in which the stone grows in the Earth offers a teaching to know yourself and your life purpose. It takes time and inner reflection to understand the messages and clues throughout the gemstone kingdom. <br><br>Matching the teachings of animals with the teachings of gemstones, Margaret Ann Lembo shows how there is symbolism in all around offering clues to light your path.

For the next nine months he and his companion, Gustave de Beaumont, traveled and observed not only prisons but also the political, economic, and social systems of the early republic. Along the way, they frequently reported back to friends and family members in France. This book presents the first translation of the complete letters Tocqueville wrote during that seminal journey, accompanied by excerpts from Beaumont&#x2019;s correspondence that provide details or different perspectives on the places, people, and American life and attitudes the travelers encountered.</p><p>These delightful letters provide an intimate portrait of the complicated, talented Tocqueville, who opened himself without prejudice to the world of Jacksonian America. Moreover, they contain many of the impressions and ideas that served as preliminary sketches for <i>Democracy in America</i>, his classic account of the American democratic system that remains an important reference work to this day. Accessible, witty, and charming, the letters Tocqueville penned while in America are of major interest to general readers, scholars, and students alike.</p></p><p><p><b>Frederick Brown</b> is professor emeritus, State University of New York at Stony Brook.

At its heart lies a new vision of Gothic identity, and of the social caste by whom it was defined and transmitted.</p><p>Although they exerted a profound, far-reaching influence on Continental geopolitics, the historical Goths (as opposed to contemporary fans of the Cure and Bauhaus) are little known. Peter Heather provides a readable precis of the Goths' role in ancient and medieval European history, examining the murky origins of various Gothic-speaking groups in the Vistula River region of northern Poland, from which they spread out eastward and southward. Pressured by the expanding Roman empire on one side and migrating Hunnish peoples from Central Asia on the other, the Goths aggressively defended their territory and eventually attacked westward, contributing to the collapse of Rome and establishing Gothic empires in Italy, Spain, and North Africa. Heather's useful book ends with the fall of these governments in the 7th century. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Between the first and seventh centuries AD, Gothic groups moved thousands of miles across the map of Europe, from the fringes of the Baltic to the shores of the Atlantic ocean. In the process, they transformed themselves from an insignificant people on the outskirts of the known world into highly militarized forces, capable of carving out successor states for themselves from the body politic of the Roman Empire.<br> <p>This book draws on all the available literary and archaeological evidence, much of the latter never before discussed in English, to reconstruct the Goths' dramatic history, and to explore the meaning of Gothic identity at different moments and in different contexts.<br> </p> <p>The volume is divided into three parts, corresponding to the three main phases in Gothic history: their early history down to the fourth century, the revolution in Gothic society set in motion by the arrival of the Huns, and the history of the Gothic successor states to the western Roman Empire.</p></p><h2>Building Construction Before Mechanization (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p>How were huge stones moved from quarries to the sites of Egyptian pyramids? How did the cathedral builders of the Middle Ages lift blocks to great heights by muscle power alone? In this intriguing book John Fitchen explains and illustrates the solutions to these and many other puzzles in preindustrial building construction. This is the first general survey of the practices and role of the builder (as opposed to the designer) in constructing an array of structures. Fitchen's approach gives a valuable hands-on feel for what it's like to work with ropes and ladders, wedges and slings; with crews engaged in well digging, bridge building, and the transporting of obelisks hundreds of miles by water and over land. The buildings discussed range from the tents, tepees, and igloos of nomadic tribes to the monumental pyramids of Egypt, the temples of Greece, the aqueducts of Rome, and the cathedrals of medieval Europe.</p></p><p>Building Construction Before Mechanization is a mine of information...There are many insights and a jargon-free use of language which will make the book accessible--and thought provoking--to a wide readership.John Fitchen, a registered architect, is Professor of Fine Arts, Emeritus, at Colgate University and the author of <i>The Construction of Gothic Cathedrals</i> and <i>The New World Dutch Barn</i>.</p><h2>Experiments in Modern Physics</h2><p>The present text is an outgrowth of such a laboratory course given by the author at the University of Rochester between 1959 and 1963.

After immersing himself in hobo subculture during the Depression, Partch came to occupy a lonely and uncompromising position as a cultural outsider.

Gilmore, a British lecturer in music, has done an outstanding job in piecing together the scanty documentary evidence of Partch's life and conducted numerous interviews with friends and associates, resulting in a superbly written, captivating work. Partch's copious travels, hand-to-mouth existence during the Depression, tumultuous formal music education, and relentless pursuit of an alternative to traditional European art music are carefully and lovingly chronicled. Gilmore writes well for the lay reader; even the section on Partch's idiosyncratic approach to intonation is eminently readable. One might wish for a more generous collection of photographs, since Partch's battery of homemade instruments are stunning visual?as well as acoustic?creations. All in all, though, this is an outstanding achievement. Highly recommended for all collections.?Larry A.

The Nobel Prize for Literature awarded to him in 1969 symbolized his acceptance by the international community. He is undoubtedly a &#39;difficult&#39; writer, and one of the virtues of Enoch Brater&#39;s concise literary biography is to give the general reader easier access to Beckett&#39;s work, particularly his later and more elliptical theatre and prose pieces. Professor Brater follows Beckett&#39;s career from the early days in Ireland, to the efflorexcence in France just after the Second World War, and beyond that to the unfolding of his success in the rest of the world following the universal appeal of his cryptic, moving play Waiting for Godot. In his analysis of the way Beckett approaches his work, Brater emphasises the Irish rhythms in his writing, and examines, at all stages, the intriguing relationships between his fiction and his compositions for theatre, film and television. Supported by a large selection of photographs, personal and public, this is a brilliant and informed study of Beckett&#39;s life and works.</p><p>Enoch Brater is Professor of English and Theatre at the University of Michigan.For writers, the face of Samuel Beckett, in all its graven, leathery, wrinkled severity, remains an object of great aspiration-it seems to be what a writer's face should look like. So it's fitting that this updated biography of the self-conscious author and playwright offers so many photos. Moving from Beckett's youth in Ireland, through his Parisian years and into his world fame, the text presents a fairly straightforward, if episodic and lightly organized, narrative of the absurdist's ascension, without much in the way of probing speculation, but plenty of detail. "Beckett made his only known stage appearance in a short skit he wrote after his return to Trinity with George Pelorson, an exchange student from Paris," opens one paragraph, by the end of which Beckett has graduated from school. Filled with asides and passing critical commentary, the text meanders alongside the photographs to draw a picture of Beckett's emotional, intellectual and professional dimensions, settling finally on the story of Waiting for Godot and its global acclaim. The candid photo diary segues into production stills from early performances, and later ones featuring celebrity casts, and the text becomes increasingly impersonal. At moments, this book feels cobbled together from a slim archive of images, but for the Beckett completist it offers a wealth of rich material. 122 illustrations. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Modern Organic Synthesis</h2><p><br>Written for the organic synthesis portion of the advanced organic chemistry course (taken by seniors and graduate students), Zweifel and Nantz's concise new text covers the essentials with exceptional coherence and clarity without bogging students down with too much unnecessary material.<br></p><p>GEORGE S.

It offers a personalized account of some of the central theoretical movements in literary studies and in the humanities over the past thirty years, together with an equally personal view of a possible future. Based on this assessment of the past and the future of literary studies and the humanities, the book develops the provocative thesis that, through their exclusive dedication to interpretation, i.e. to the reconstruction and attribution of meaning, the humanities have become incapable of addressing a dimension in all cultural phenomena that is as important as the dimension of meaning. Interpretation alone cannot do justice to the dimension of "presence," a dimension in which cultural phenomena and cultural events become tangible and have an impact on our senses and our bodies. <i>Production of Presence</i> is a passionate plea for a rethinking and a reshaping of the intellectual practice within the humanities.</p><p>&#x201c;...Production of Presence is focused and persuasive.

How did philanthropy become such a powerful and integral force in American society? <i>Philanthropy in America</i> is the first book to explore in depth the twentieth-century growth of this unique phenomenon. Ranging from the influential large-scale foundations established by tycoons such as John D. Rockefeller, Sr., and the mass mobilization of small donors by the Red Cross and March of Dimes, to the recent social advocacy of individuals like Bill Gates and George Soros, respected historian Olivier Zunz chronicles the tight connections between private giving and public affairs, and shows how this union has enlarged democracy and shaped history.</p><p> Zunz looks at the ways in which American philanthropy emerged not as charity work, but as an open and sometimes controversial means to foster independent investigation, problem solving, and the greater good. Andrew Carnegie supported science research and higher education, catapulting these fields to a prominent position on the world stage. In the 1950s, Howard Pew deliberately funded the young Billy Graham to counter liberal philanthropies, prefiguring the culture wars and increased philanthropic support for religious causes. And in the 1960s, the Ford Foundation supported civil rights through education, voter registration drives, and community action programs.

His book places the subject into a larger societal and global framework, and will be of great interest to historians and social scientists working on the dynamics and ethos of modern capitalism, as well as to all individuals involved in the world of foundations and NGOs."<b>--V.R. Berghahn, Columbia University</b></p><p>"Compelling and beautifully written, this narrative about the development of philanthropy from the nineteenth century through the present day bears the hallmark of rigorous scholarship and authoritative research. Showing how the diversity of givers and giving in America has advanced the nation's social, cultural, intellectual, and economic life, Zunz demonstrates that big money philanthropy and mass giving have left a uniquely democratic imprint on the country and set an example for philanthropic efforts around the world."<b>--Vartan Gregorian, Carnegie Corporation of New York</b></p><p>"This beautifully crafted book, by master historian Olivier Zunz, transforms our understanding of American civil society. Zunz compellingly traces the often auspicious, yet sometimes troublesome relationships that bind government to philanthropy, money to responsibility, and charitable decisions to social reform and democratic performance. Anyone interested in U.S. politics and society will want to engage with this riveting narrative."<b>--Ira Katznelson, Columbia University</b></p><p>"Can capitalism produce general social betterment? A history of the unique American experiment of using private wealth for the public good, this very important book demonstrates that the enlightened pursuit of self-interest enhances the commonweal. It also shows how the encounter between philanthropy and the state has, in the United States, created a nonprofit sector capable of addressing the most urgent claims for social justice. No other book provides a comprehensive account of philanthropy at this level of scholarly mastery."<b>--Stanley Katz, Princeton University</b></p><p>"By illuminating the important history of America's vast not-for-profit sector, Zunz has made a major contribution to American historical scholarship.

Her admirers have long waited, however, for a book adequately showcasing her range as a portraitist and reproducing some of the hundreds of less-familiar portraits in her archives. Lorenz deserves high praise for ending the wait by bringing 220 intelligently chosen and sequenced plates to light. He contributes an informative essay, too, that takes Cunningham very seriously, as not everyone else has done, including herself, for she had a wry, self-deprecating humor and declined to self-mythologize. The "problem" with Cunningham was her versatility. She is not easy to categorize as a portraitist, for she had no formulas and responded to each subject freshly, posing them, carefully or candidly, sometimes in sunlight; sometimes in soft, controlled light; sometimes up close; and sometimes in a telling environment. Consistent are her genuine interest in each person's uniqueness, her strong sense of design, and her ability to use light dramatically. Even collections including every other Cunningham book should add this one. <i>Gretchen Garner</i></p><h2>Automotive Mechanics</h2><p>This edition of the text covers the latest developments in automotive design, construction, operation, diagnosis, and service.

In <i>Gods and Demons, Priests and Scholars</i>, Lincoln assembles a collection of essays that both illustrates and reveals the benefits of his methodology, making a case for a critical religious studies that starts with skepticism but is neither cynical nor crude.</p>The book begins with Lincoln&#x2019;s &#x201c;Theses on Method&#x201d; and ends with &#x201c;The (Un)discipline of Religious Studies,&#x201d; in which he unsparingly considers the failings of uncritical and nonhistorical approaches to the study of religions. In between, Lincoln presents new examinations of problems in ancient religions and relates these cases to larger comparative themes. While bringing to light important features of the formation of pantheons and the constructions of demons, chaos, and the dead, Lincoln demonstrates that historians of religions should take religious things&#x2014;inspired scriptures, sacred centers, salvific rites, communities graced by divine favor&#x2014;as the theories of interested humans that shape perception, community, and experiences. As he shows, it is for their terrestrial influence, and not their sacred origins, that religious phenomena merit consideration by the historian.&nbsp;Tackling many questions central to religious study, <i>Gods and Demons, Priests and Scholars</i> will be a touchstone for the history of religions in the twenty-first century.</p><p><b>Bruce Lincoln</b> is the Caroline E. Haskell Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago, where he is also affiliated with the Departments of Anthropology, Classics, Medieval Studies, and Middle Eastern Studies.<p>&#x201c;Bruce Lincoln is a <i>rara avis</i>. His combination of precise technical analysis of ancient religious texts, allied to a grand, comparative vision of religion in society, past and present, informs a reflection, at once anxious and radical, anchored in the predicament of our own times. This combination produces a humanistic approach, devoid of grandiloquence, and this strikingly original book will be of great importance to all students of ancient religions and to historians of religion in general.&#x201d;</p> (Guy Stroumsa, University of Oxford)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Bruce Lincoln has a gift for selecting persuasive examples, engaging them with creativity, and linking them to broader themes and scholarly debates. His cogent and provocative arguments in this book range across the scope of religious history, from the ancient world to twentieth-century Latin America, and engage with a number of significant topics, including religious violence, nationalism, definitions of religion, and religious innovation. Eminently teachable, <i>Gods and Demons, Priests and Scholars</i> is a book that invites critical analysis and reflection and will be a valuable addition to discussions about theory and method in the study of the history of religions.&#x201d;</p> (Randall Styers, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill)<br><br>&#x201c;A consistently critical and thoughtful assessment of the history of religions.&#x201d; (<i>Catholic Sentinel</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Resulting from his masterly language skills, the main area of interest in <i>Gods and Demons, Priests and Scholars</i> is unsurprisingly what Lincoln since many years avoids to label Indo-European religion. These chapters on ancient religions profoundly deepen our understanding of the mythologies and symbolic worlds of Persia, Vedic India, the Old Norse and the ancient world in general.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Method and Theory in the Study of Religions</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Bruce Lincoln, like his teachers, has become one of the &#x2018;giants&#x2019; in the discipline of religious studies, and the essays collected in <i>Gods and Demons, Priests and Scholars</i> are a fine example of the methodological approach known in the field as the &#x2018;history of religions,&#x2019; practiced by perhaps its most spirited and able exponent. This would be an excellent addition to any upper-level undergraduate or graduate syllabus considering current approaches to the academic study of religion.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Reviews in Religion and Theology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Patrols with insightful expertise the ancient/medieval worlds of Old Norse gods and heroes, Zoroastrian cosmology and demonology, Hesiod&#x2019;s <i>Theogony</i>, and indeed Vedic culture . . . not to mention politicised socioreligious conflicts in 20th-century Guatemala. . . .

In his peak years the Latvian-born maestro was ranked third in the world behind Capablanca and Alekhine. His greatest successes were first place in Dresden in 1926 (8�/9, one and a half points ahead of Alekhine) and Carlsbad 1929 (15/21, ahead of Capablanca, Spielmann and Rubinstein).<br><br>However, Nimzowitsch will first and foremost be remembered as the founder of the Hypermodern movement and the author of the undisputed classics My System and Chess Praxis. In his first book, he expounded his theories of prophylaxis, blockades and much more, while providing ground-breaking insights in pawn-structures. In the sequel Nimzowitsch demonstrated how he had successfully tested his theories in his games.<br><br>Nimzowitsch's masterpieces are unique landmarks in the history of chess.

Perhaps not all of his convictions have stood the test of time, but even today, any chess student will deepen his understanding and broaden his play while enjoying the author's insights and witticisms.<br><br>Part of the charm of Nimzowitsch's prose was his idiosyncratic use of the German language, which has carefully been preserved in Robert Sherwood's new translation. <br><br>Bonus: Added are the influential essays The Blockade and On the History of the Chess Revolution 1911-1914. This edition gives the reader access to Nimzowitsch's four major works!</p><p>&#34;Robert Sherwood has finally succeeded in rendering Nimzowitsch faithfully, something earlier translations have failed to do.

This companion is a detailed guide through the visible and not-so-visible beauties of LaTeX. As such, it is a comprehensive treatise of those points not fully discussed in Leslie Lamport's LaTeX: A Document Preparation System (henceforth referred to as the LaTeX book)&nbsp;49. Extensions to basic LaTeX, as described in that book, are discussed, so that the LaTeX book, together with this companion, provide a ready reference to the full functionality of the LaTeX system. <p>Due to its flexibility, ease of use, and professional typographic quality, LaTeX is presently used in almost all areas of science and the humanities. Unlike many word processors, LaTeX (and its underlying formatting engine TeX) comes free of charge and is not linked to any particular computer architecture or operating system. Since LaTeX source files are plain text files, it is possible to ship them, and the packages referenced, from any computer to any other computer in the world (over electronic networks or via normal mail). The recipient will be able to obtain a final output copy identical to the one generated at the sender's site, independently of the hardware used. Thus members of groups, geographically spread over several sites in different countries, or even on different continents, can now work together in composing complex documents where different parts can be dealt with by different individuals, and then brought together without problems. Moreover, the use of electronic manuscripts has the potential to speed up the publication of papers by publishers. </p><p>LaTeX is not difficult to learn and a beginner can benefit from the system after reading through the first few chapters of LamportLeslie Lamport's LaTeX book, the basic reference on LaTeX. After some experience, you will probably have to solve some more advanced problems whose solution cannot be found directly in that book. If you are one of those users who would like to know how LaTeX can be extended to create the nicest documents possible without becoming a (La)TeX guru , then this book is for you. </p><p>You will be guided, step by step, through the various important areas of LaTeX and be shown the links that exist between them. The structure of a LaTeX document, the basic formatting tools, and the layout of the page are all dealt with in great detail. A sufficient library of packages in the area of floats, graphics, tables, PostScript, and multi-language support are presented in a convenient way. This book is the first volume to include all of the important LaTeX tools, such as: up-to-date descriptions of version&nbsp;2 of the New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS2), the AMSLaTeX mathematics extensions, the epic and eepic extensions to LaTeX's picture environment, and the MakeIndex and BibTeX programs for producing and controlling the generation of indices and bibliographic references. Finally, an overview of ways to define new commands and environments, lengths, boxes, general lists, etc., as well as ways of facilitating the handling of these objects, complete the picture. </p><p>All three of us have been involved for several years in the support and development of LaTeX applications in various professional environments and countries. We have taught the secrets of LaTeX to many different audiences, and have been listening to the user community by following the discussions in the text processing related news groups and at TeX conferences. This has allowed us to gather a coherent view of a vast collection of subjects, which, we think, you might need one day if you want to fully exploit the richness and strengths of the LaTeX system. Note, however, that this book is not a replacement for, but a companion to, the LaTeX book. You are assumed to have read the first part of that book, and in any case, it should be considered a reference for precise and full description of the LaTeX commands. </p><p>To make the presented information even more complete and useful, our readers are kindly invited to send their comments, suggestions, or remarks to any one of the authors. We shall be glad to correct any remaining mistakes or oversights in a future edition, and are open to suggestions for improvements or the inclusion of important developments that we may have overlooked. </p><p> LaTeX2e--The New LaTeX Release </p><p>Over the years many extensions have been developed for LaTeX with one unfortunate result: incompatible LaTeX formats came into use at different sites. Thus, to process documents from various places, a site maintainer was forced to keep LaTeX (with and without NFSS), SliTeX, AMSLaTeX, and so on. In addition, when looking at a source file it was not always clear what format the document was written for. </p><p>To put an end to this unsatisfactory situation a new LaTeX release was announced for fall 1993 that brings all such extensions back under a single format and thus prevents the proliferation of mutually incompatible dialects of LaTeX&nbsp;2.09. With LaTeX2e the new font selection will be standard and style files like amstex (formerly AMSLaTeX format) or slides (formerly SliTeX format) will become extension packages, all working with the same base format. The introduction of a new release also made it possible to add a small number of often-requested features (like an extended version of #79#&gt;newcommand). All the new possibilities are described in this book, thus allowing you to make full use of the new LaTeX release. </p><p>To make it easy to distinguish between old LaTeX&nbsp;2.09 sources and new sources (making use of new features), the first command in a LaTeX document was changed from \documentstyle to \documentclass, thus enabling the software to automatically detect an old source file and switch to compatibility mode if necessary. </p><p> The LaTeX3 Project </p><p>LaTeX is presently being rewritten under the coordination of one of the authors (Frank Mittelbach), Chris Rowley and Rainer Sch�pf. This endeavor is called the LaTeX3 Project&nbsp;57. A lot of the functionality described in this book as extensions to basic LaTeX will be available in that system: as part of the kernel, or in one of the extension packages. To help funding, half of the royalties from this book will go directly to the LaTeX3 Project. Therefore, when buying this book, you not only obtain a handy, complete, and up-to-date reference to many important and useful packages available with LaTeX today, but you also actively contribute to making LaTeX more powerful and user-friendly in the future. </p><p> How to Read This Book </p><p>The titles of the various chapters should convey relatively clearly the subject area addressed in each case. In principle, all chapters can be read more or less independently and, if necessary, pointers are given to where complementary information can be found in other parts of the book. </p><p> Chapter 1 gives a short introduction to the LaTeX system. </p><p>Chapter 2 discusses generic and document-oriented markup. </p><p>Chapter 3 describes LaTeX's basic typesetting commands. </p><p>Chapter 4 explains which tools are available to globally define the</p><p>visual layout of the pages of a document by using pagestyles. </p><p>Chapter 5 shows how to assemble material into columns and rows with</p><p>the extended tabular and array environments, and</p><p>their multipage equivalents--supertabular and longtable. </p><p>Chapter 6 provides a general treatment of floating material. </p><p>Chapter 7 discusses in detail LaTeX's New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS2)</p><p>and presents its various user commands.</p><p>It is shown how to add new fonts, both in math and text mode. </p><p>Chapter 8 reviews the amstex package, which adds</p><p>many powerful typesetting commands in the field of mathematics. </p><p>Chapter 9 looks at the problem of using LaTeX in the multi-language</p><p>or non-English environment.</p><p>The babel system and other language-specific packages are described. </p><p>Chapter 10 addresses the field of device-independent graphics</p><p>showing how the epic, eepic and other packages</p><p>extend the possibilities</p><p>of LaTeX's basic picture environment. </p><p>Chapter 11 shows how the PostScript page description language not only</p><p>can turn LaTeX into a full-blown graphics utility, but also how it</p><p>makes it possible, via the NFSS, for a user to choose a font</p><p>from amongst</p><p>hundreds of font families, available as PostScript Type&nbsp;1 outlines. </p><p>Chapter 12 tackles the problems associated with preparing an index.</p><p>The program MakeIndex is described in detail. </p><p>Chapter 13 surveys how LaTeX's companion program BibTeX tries</p><p>to solve problems related to maintaining bibliographic data bases.</p><p>Various existing bibliographic styles are discussed and the format of the</p><p>BibTeX language used in the style files is presented in detail,</p><p>allowing the user to customize an existing style. </p><p>Chapter 14 shows how to document LaTeX files</p><p>using the doc package and its companion program</p><p>docstrip. </p><p>Appendix 1 first reviews how to handle and manipulate the basic LaTeX programming</p><p>structures. The extensions introduced by the calc package</p><p>in the field of arithmetic operations, and</p><p>extended control structures added to LaTeX2e</p><p>are discussed. </p><p>Appendix 2 explains how to get the files described in this book</p><p>from the various TeX archives or from the TeX Users Groups. </p><p>In order to make the examples as independent as possible from basic TeX, extensive use has been made of the packages calc and ifthen, which are described in the appendices A.4 and A.5. You should study the extensions to LaTeX, introduced in these packages, if you want to understand how many of the examples in this book function in detail. </p><p>Many examples make use of new features in LaTeX2e; especially font changes for text are all done in LaTeX2e style, i.e.,with the commands shown in table&nbsp;7.2 on page 171. Abbreviated forms, like {\bf word} are normally not used, since they are style defined commands and may or may not be available for all classes of documents. </p><p>While it is certainly possible to make good use of most parts of this book within a LaTeX&nbsp;2.09 environment (the event of LaTeX2e happened after 90% of the book was finished) we suggest that you upgrade to the new version as soon as possible so that the worldwide community of LaTeX users again speaks a single language. As said above, LaTeX2e is able to identify and process old documents written for LaTeX&nbsp;2.09. However, packages written or updated for LaTeX2e will not run with the old system. </p><p> Typographic Conventions </p><p>As explained in the discussion about the links between content and form or generic and layout markup, it is essential that the presentation of the material conveys immediately its function in the framework of the text. Therefore, we present below the typographic conventions used in this book. </p><p>LaTeX command and environment names are in monospaced type (for example, #133#&gt;caption, enumerate, \begin{tabular}), while names of package and class files are in sans-serif type (eg. article). </p><p>The syntax of LaTeX constructs is presented inside a rectangular box. Command arguments are shown in italic type. </p><p></p><p>\commandname{arg1}{arg1}{arg3}</p><p> </p><p>Lines containing examples with LaTeX commands are indented and are typeset in a monospaced type at a size somewhat smaller than that of the main text. \chapter{Title of the Chapter} \section{Section Title} Some text... </p><p>When it is important to show the result of a series of commands, then the input and output are shown side by side as follows: <br><br> </p><p>For large examples, where the input and output cannot be shown conveniently alongside one another, the following layout is used: </p><p><br><br> </p><p>Commands to be typed by the user on a computer terminal are shown in monospaced type and are underlined, e.g.,: This is user input. </p><p> Using All Those Packages </p><p>In this book we describe over 150 packages and options that extend or modify LaTeX's basic possibilities. In order to show their action, we (in principle) have to load them all at the same time. For various reasons that is impractical, if not impossible. Indeed many packages, like program, use up a lot of counters, and TeX only allows a total of 256 counters. Therefore, when you hit this limit you must reduce the number of files you load simultaneously. In the production of this book we used a different strategy: we prepared some of the examples as separate files and included them as Encapsulated PostScript. Moreover, we used the package hackalloc. It redefines the allocation primitive so that all allocation becomes group-local. This means that by loading packages only when they are needed inside a brace group, the counter and length variables will be deallocated when you exit from the group. This procedure, however, can have some side effects, and should only be used with great care. However, we used most of the packages together, with the result that we had to recompile TeX several times during the preparation of this book. One of the log files produced during the last steps of the preparation showed the following summary: Here is how much of TeX's memory you used: 9692 strings out of 16716 118315 string characters out of 133654 236569 words of memory out of 262141 8131 multiletter control sequences out of 9500 81058 words of font info for 228 fonts, out of 90000 for 255 20 hyphenation exceptions out of 607 34i,23n,41p,509b,1403s stack positions out of 300i,40n,60p,3000b,4000s Output written on companion.dvi (555 pages, 2008780 bytes). As you can see, we nearly reached the font limit (which cannot be raised further) because of the many fonts shown in chapter 7, and the usage for strings, characters, main memory, and control sequences is probably much higher than in any LaTeX run you ever made. This is not surprising given that the whole book is produced in a single LaTeX run with all those packages working together to produce the examples. </p><p>Even when you do not reach a limit of the kind mentioned above, there are other interference effects between different packages. For instance, some extensions such as french make some characters active (i.e.,some characters act as though they were control sequences)&nbsp;. Problems may result when such a character is then encountered in another package. This means that not all of the packages described in this book can be used together. Sometimes you can solve the problem by loading problematic packages as one of the last #161#&gt;usepackage declarations. Also, some packages make the @ character active (eg.amstex), and this can have nasty consequences if you load other packages that use the @ character. </p><p>As a rule of thumb, if you observe some odd behavior when you add a package to an existing list of packages, which seemed to work nicely together before, there might be a compatibility problem. Try loading the new file at the end, and if that does not work, take out each of the other files one by one. In this way you might find the file or files that are responsible for the problem. </p><p><br></p><p>0201541998P04062001</p>documents.

But in New England this preeminence had not been present in the first years of settlement; it had been achieved in the course of three generations of social development as the merchants often Puritans themselves, rose within the Bible Commonwealths to challenge the domination of the Puritan fathers.</p><p>In lively detail Mr. Bailyn here presents the struggle of the merchants to achieve full social recognition as their successes in trade and in such industries as fishing and lumbering offered them avenues to power. Surveying the rise of merchant families, he offers a portrait in depth of the emergence of a new social group whose interests and changing social position powerfully affected the developing character of American society.</p><p>The story of this group is the story of people and of their many&#x2013;sided interests. The merchants were united by the demands of their common devotion to trade, yet they did not form a socially homogeneous unit. In fact their social differences&#x2015;created in the confusions and dislocations of the early days of settlement came to play an important role in their business and political activities. Moreover, their commercial ventures, successes, and failures affected their social and political situation. Internationalists by occupation, they were deeply affected by personal relations with Europeans as well as by events in the Old World.</p><p>Drawing on source material from many fields&#x2015;business records, religious and political data, literary remains, and genealogical information&#x2015;Mr. Bailyn has discovered much that is new about the merchants, and has brought it all together into a composite portrait of our economic founding fathers that is fascinating in itself and that will reorient our thinking about many aspects of early New England history.</p></p><p>Bernard Bailyn is Adams University Professor, Emeritus, and James Duncan Phillips Professor of Early American History, Emeritus, at Harvard University.&#x201c;This study should be of great interest to sociologists interested in social stratification, religion, and political behavior. The author has analyzed in detail the way in which the growth of trade in seventeenth century New England led to the emergence of an upper class based on mercantile wealth, and the gradual disintegration of the Puritan Commonwealth.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>American Sociological Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In the past, the social history of seventeenth-century New England has been written in terms of the Puritan Zion, not of the marketplace. The interaction of these two forces&#x2015;meetinghouse and counting-house&#x2015;is the basic problem to which Mr. Bailyn has devoted this excellent book...It is social history as it has seldom been written and business history as it should be written&#x2015;a story of people, not of prices and trends; of merchants, not mercantile houses.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>American Historical Review</i></b></p><h2>To Jerusalem and Back: A Personal Account</h2><p>Bellow probes the complex identity and indomitable spirit of Israel through interviews with Israelis from all levels of society.</p><p><b>Saul Bellow&nbsp;</b>was praised for his vision, his ear for detail, his humor, and the masterful artistry of his prose.

Some of the bitterest, saddest letters Kerouac wrote to his 21-year-old lover, Joyce Glassman, reveal the personal cost of the hysterical media attention that followed. Yet their early correspondence shows a side of Kerouac not always evident in his fiction: tender, spiritual, and supportive of Glassman's efforts to write her first novel. Now known as Joyce Johnson, she supplements the text of their epistles with commentary whose sensitive, rueful tone will be familiar to readers of her memoir, <i>Minor Characters</i>. The loving but independent air she assumed in her letters, Johnson notes, came from painful rewriting to eliminate all hints of hurt or need; as he wandered in and out of her life, Kerouac kept reminding her he didn't want to be tied down, even as he urged her to come visit whatever city he'd alighted in. Spiced with marvelously evocative period slang like <i>dig</i> and <i>swing</i>, and references to friends such as Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady, this poignant epistolary record of a 22-month love affair also brings to life an exciting moment in American cultural history, when the Beat writers gave "powerful, irresistible voices to subversive longings." <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Joyce Johnson is the author of three novels, including <b>The Night Caf�</b>. Her other books include <b>Minor Characters</b>, which was the winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, and <b>Door Wide Open: A Beat Love Affair in Letters, 1957&#x2013;1958</b>.<br>Jack Kerouac(1922-1969), the central figure of the Beat Generation, was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1922 and died in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1969. Among his many novels are <b>On the Road</b>, <b>The Dharma Bums</b>, <b>Big Sur</b>, and <b>Visions of Cody</b>.</p><h2>Bombs Away!: The Story of a Bomber Team</h2><p><b>A magnificent volume of short novels and an essential World War II report from one of America?s great twentieth-century writers</b><br><br>On the heels of the enormous success of his masterwork <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>?and at the height of the American war effort?John Steinbeck, one of the most prolific and influential literary figures of his generation, wrote <i>Bombs Away</i>, a nonfiction account of his experiences with U.S. Army Air Force bomber crews during World War II. Now, for the first time since its original publication in 1942, Penguin Classics presents this exclusive edition of Steinbeck?s introduction to the then-nascent U.S. Army Air Force and its bomber crew?the essential core unit behind American air power that Steinbeck described as ?the greatest team in the world.?<br><br></p><p><p><b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely.

We wonder why, for some people, success seems to come so naturally.</p> <p>Could the secret be how they were parented?</p> <p>This book unveils how parenting helped shape some of the most fascinating people you will ever encounter, by doing things that almost any parent can do. You don't have to be wealthy or influential to ensure your child reaches their greatest potential. What you do need is commitment&#x2014;and the strategies outlined in this book.</p> <p>In <em>The Formula: Unlocking the Secrets to Raising Highly Successful Children</em>, Harvard economist Ronald Ferguson, named in a <em>New York Times</em> profile as the foremost expert on the US educational "achievement gap," along with award-winning journalist Tatsha Robertson, reveal an intriguing blueprint for helping children from all types of backgrounds become successful adults.</p> <p>Informed by hundreds of interviews, the book includes never-before-published&nbsp;insights from the "How I was Parented Project"&nbsp;at Harvard University, which draws on the varying life experiences of 120 Harvard students. Ferguson and Robertson have isolated a pattern with eight roles of the "Master Parent" that make up the Formula: the Early Learning Partner, the Flight Engineer, the Fixer, the Revealer, the Philosopher, the Model, the Negotiator, and the GPS Navigational Voice.</p> <p><em>The Formula</em> combines the latest scientific research on child development, learning, and brain growth and illustrates with life stories of extraordinary individuals&#x2014;from the Harvard-educated Ghanian entrepreneur who, as the young child of a rural doctor, was welcomed in his father's secretive late-night political meetings; to the nation's youngest state-wide elected official, whose hardworking father taught him math and science during grueling days on the family farm in Kentucky; to the DREAMer immigration lawyer whose low-wage mother pawned her wedding ring to buy her academically outstanding child a special flute.</p> <p><em>The Formula</em> reveals strategies on how you&#x2014;regardless of race, class, or background&#x2014;can help your children become the best they can be and shows ways to maximize their chances for happy and purposeful lives.</p></p><p><p><strong>Ronald F.

Drawing from years of experience covering Syria for <em>Vanity Fair, Newsweek</em>, and the front pages of the <em>New York Times</em>, award-winning journalist Janine di Giovanni gives us a tour de force of war reportage, all told through the perspective of ordinary people&#x2015;among them a doctor, a nun, a musician, and a student. What emerges is an extraordinary picture of the devastating human consequences of armed conflict, one that charts an apocalyptic but at times tender story of life in a jihadist war zone. Recalling celebrated works by Ryszard Kapus�cin�ski, Philip Gourevitch, and Anne Applebaum, <em>The Morning They Came for Us</em>, through its unflinching account of a nation on the brink of disintegration, becomes an unforgettable testament to resilience in the face of nihilistic human debasement. 30 illustrations</p><p>Janine di Giovanni, Middle East editor of Newsweek and contributing editor at Vanity Fair, has won seven major awards, including the National Magazine Award and two Amnesty International Awards. Her work is widely anthologized, and her article from Harper&#x2019;s, "Life during Wartime," was chosen by Paul Theroux for The Best American Travel Writing. The author of seven books, di Giovanni is a graduate of the Iowa Writers&#x2019; Workshop and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, where she was a Pakis Fellow. She lives in Paris.&#x201c;Devastating . . . . &nbsp;Like the work of the Belarussian Nobel laureate&nbsp;Svetlana Alexievich, Ms. di Giovanni&#x2019;s book gives voice to ordinary people living through a dark time in history; and like Anthony Shadid&#x2019;s powerful 2005 book, <em>Night Draws Near</em> (which recounted the aftermath of the American invasion of Iraq), it chronicles the intimate fallout that war has on women, children and families. A longtime reporter who covered the wars in Bosnia, Chechnya and Sierra Leone, Ms. di Giovanni writes here with urgency and anguish &#x2015; determined to testify to what she has witnessed because she wants &#x2018;people never to forget.&#x2019; . . . . Her testimony is contained here in this searing and necessary book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michiko Kakutani, <em>New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Necessary, difficult and elating. [Di Giovanni&#x2019;s] reporting from the Syrian revolution and war is clear-eyed and engaged in the best sense &#x2013; engaged in the human realm rather than the abstractly political. . . . Such reporters as Giovanni, who not only visit but also live (and often die) through wars not their own, are heroic. These are the Marie Colvins, Paul Conroys, Ali Mustafas of journalism, reporters motivated by commitment to the act of witnessing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robin Yassin-Kassab, <em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Di Giovanni's work, informed by her extensive experience as a journalist, shows a keen ability to capture violent conflicts from multiple sides...This book, haunted by the international failure to intervene effectively, gives readers an on-the-ground experience of the devastating seasons that followed the promise of the Arab Spring...[Di Giovanni] makes its reality fully tangible and tragic.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;With a potent mix of sensitivity and outrage, Di Giovanni relates firsthand accounts of deprivation and suffering from the people caught up in the conflict...[T]heir stories reveal in harrowing detail the horrific nature of the war. The expert perspective of this seasoned war correspondent proves invaluable to understanding Syria today.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Di Giovanni] is a master of war reporting, especially its civilian side. Thanks to her bitter sacrifice, Western readers may begin to appreciate the chaos that Syrian refugees continue to flee. This brilliant, necessary book will hopefully do for Syria what Herr's <em>Dispatches</em> (1977) did for Vietnam.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Di Giovanni presents a devastating picture of the horrors of civil war and the disintegration of Syrian society.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Elizabeth Hayford, <em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It is crucial to reveal the human stories behind the news &#x2013; and in <em>The Morning They Came for Us,</em>&nbsp;Janine di Giovanni does this with heartbreaking eloquence...Her account of Syria is a testimony to the power of empathy, conscience and understanding.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Elif Shafak, <em>Financial Times</em></strong></p><h2>Social Welfare: A History of the American Response to Need</h2><p>Social Welfare - Seventh Edition, describes and analyzes the ideas that have shaped the history of social welfare--from the Colonial Period to the present day--by using original documents from each respective period through the current Bush Administration.

From the embattled farmers who &#x201c;fired the shot heard round the world&#x201d; in the stirring &#x201c;Concord Hymn,&#x201d; to the flower in &#x201c;The Rhodora,&#x201d; whose existence demonstrates &#x201c;that if eyes were made for seeing, / Then Beauty is its own excuse for being,&#x201d; Emerson celebrates the existence of the sublime in the human and in nature. <br><br>Combining intensity of feeling with his famous idealism, Emerson&#x2019;s poems reveal a moving, more intimate side of the man revered as the Sage of Concord.</p><p>Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803�&#x2014;1882) was a renowned lecturer and writer, whose ideas on philosophy, religion, and literature influenced many writers, including Henry David Thoreau and Walt Whitman.

Horwitz argues that our current conceptions of mental illness as a disease fit only a small number of serious psychological conditions and that most conditions currently regarded as mental illness are cultural constructions, normal reactions to stressful social circumstances, or simply forms of deviant behavior. <br><br>"Thought-provoking and important. . .Drawing on and consolidating the ideas of a range of authors, Horwitz challenges the existing use of the term mental illness and the psychiatric ideas and practices on which this usage is based. . . . Horwitz enters this controversial territory with confidence, conviction, and clarity."&#x2014;Joan Busfield, <i>American Journal of Sociology <br></i><br>"Horwitz properly identifies the financial incentives that urge therapists and drug companies to proliferate psychiatric diagnostic categories. He correctly identifies the stranglehold that psychiatric diagnosis has on research funding in mental health. Above all, he provides a sorely needed counterpoint to the most strident advocates of disease-model psychiatry."&#x2014;Mark Sullivan, <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i><br><br>"Horwitz makes at least two major contributions to our understanding of mental disorders. First, he eloquently draws on evidence from the biological and social sciences to create a balanced, integrative approach to the study of mental disorders. Second, in accomplishing the first contribution, he provides a fascinating history of the study and treatment of mental disorders. . . from early asylum work to the rise of modern biological psychiatry."&#x2014;Debra Umberson, <i>Quarterly Review of Biology</i><br><br></p><p>In this timely and provocative critique of modern psychiatry, Allan V. Horwitz examines current conceptions of mental illness as a disease. He argues that this notion fits only a small number of serious psychological conditions, and that most conditions currently regarded as mental illness are cultural constructions, normal reactions to stressful social circumstances, or simply forms of deviant behavior. According to Horwitz, the formulation of mental illness as disease benefits various interest groups, including mental health researchers and clinicians, prescriptive drug manufacturers, and mental health advocacy groups, all of whom promote disease-based models. Presenting case studies in maladies such as hysteria, multiple personality disorder, and depression, he examines the major causes and treatments of mental illness, paying special attention to the use of pharmaceuticals. While biologically based causes and treatments fit some of the entities formulated, Horwitz finds that more often than not, social responses offer far more suitable remedies.<b>Allan V.

His first book, The Republic Reborn, recieved the National Historical Society Book prize for best book of 1989. Watts currently lives in Columbia, Missouri....a massive grab bag of a book... <i>The Magic Kingdom</i> is an invaluable mine of material on how the American century became the Disney century, a world from Russia to Chile dominated by a Disney-esque culture overseen by the company Walt created. However, as we ready ourselves for our exit from Walt's century into what looks increasingly like the century of Disney Inc., we still await the biographer who can lead us, critical faculties intact, to an exit sign. Perhaps, though, as in any dystopian story worth its salt, there will be no exit from this theater. -- <i>The Los Angeles Times Sunday Book Review, Tom Engelhardt</i><br><br>Part biography, part cultural history, <i>The Magic Kingdom</i> gives us a vivid portrait of the man behind Mickey Mouse, while at the same time situating his anomalous achievement within a social and aesthetic context. We are left with an appreciation of just why Disney's work resonated so strongly in the popular imagination and how it evolved over six decades.... a terrifically readable and illuminating book. -- <i>The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani</i><br><br>Walt Disney's life was a fascinating journey--would that the book were equally fascinating. Unfortunately, Watts ... has chosen a poor format. He'll sum up in a few pages the progress Disney made over, say, a decade and then spend the next few chapters going over and over the ramifications. In discussing Disney's numerous projects, he'll dutifully, ploddingly report what the critics said, both for and against, only occasionally enlivening the proceedings with his own point of view.... Watts's scholarly research (there are 57 pages of notes) has turned up enough information for several books. Unfortunately, he tells his story in a way Walt wouldn't have let get past a first draft. -- <i>Reason, Steve Kurtz</i></p><h2>A First Course in Abstract Algebra</h2><p>An introduction to abstract algebra.

Denis Wood shows how maps are not impartial reference objects, but rather instruments of communication, persuasion, and power. Like paintings, they express a point of view. By connecting us to a reality that could not exist in the absence of maps--a world of property lines and voting rights, taxation districts and enterprise zones--they embody and project the interests of their creators. Sampling the scope of maps available today, illustrations include Peter Gould's AIDS map, Tom Van Sant's map of the earth, U.S. Geological Survey maps, and a child's drawing of the world. THE POWER OF MAPS was published in conjunction with an exhibition at the Cooper Hewitt Museum, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Design.<br></p><p>Denis Wood, PhD, is an independent scholar living in Raleigh, North Carolina. He lectures widely and is the author of a dozen books and over 150 papers. From 1974 to 1996, he taught in the School of Design at North Carolina State University. In 1992, he curated the Power of Maps exhibition for the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design (remounted at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC, in 1994), for which he wrote the book <i>The Power of Maps.</i> His other books include <i>Rethinking the Power of Maps</i>; <i>Making Maps, Third Edition</i> (coauthored with John Krygier); and <i>Weaponizing Maps</i> (coauthored with Joe Bryan)."If compelled to cite only a single book on cartography to stock a desert-island shelf or to assign to the eager novice, this is the automatic choice....Although I have been drawing and poring over maps, as well as reading about them, since childhood, I received more revelations about their essential nature and larger meanings from this one powerful, disturbing, totally convincing essay than from all the other books, articles, and lectures on the subject I have ever encountered.'' --Wilbur Zelinsky, The Pennsylvania State University <br><br>"Combining both topical issues relevant to lay readers and serious scholarship, Denis Wood's <i>The Power of Maps</i> will provoke, amuse, tweak, and inform anyone who has had occasion to use, or merely peruse, a map--which is to say, everyone. It is a relentless entertainment--relentlessly challenging to traditional assumptions about cartography, relentlessly witty as it deconstructs (read: demolishes) the pretense of neutral, `scientific' map-making, and relentlessly contrary in reminding us that maps reflect social choices and serve particular political interests.'' --Stephen S. Hall, author of <i>Mapping the Next Millennium</i><br><br>"Perhaps the simplest thing to say is that there is nothing quite like it! There are, of course, countless conventional accounts of cartography -- usually a combination of the history of cartography and a catalogue of its technical achievements-- but these are usually Whiggish tales which celebrate the progressive advance of cartography towards 'Truth.' Apart from a short discussion of so-called 'propaganda maps' (which is there simply to mark a departure from the norm, so to speak, an anomaly) these books rarely offer any sustained discussion of what one might call the cultural and political implications of maps and mapping. With the current explosion of interest in cultural politics and social theory, both inside and outside human geography, there is an obvious need for a discussion which resists those conventions. I can think of only Mark Monmonier's HOW TO LIE WITH MAPS -- which from all accounts has done extremely well, but is narrower in scope than Wood's text -- and the late Brian Harley's marvelous essays on deconstruction and mapping -- which may well be too abstract for many readers. In any event, I have no doubt that Denis Wood's book will be a major contribution to this emerging discussion of the power and politics of maps and mapping: it is written in a clear and accessible style but none the less deals with some of the most complex issues in contemporary debates over power, knowledge and spatiality. It is immensely engaging: the examples and illustrations are to the point and by no means obvious, and the issues that are raised extend far beyond the confines of any purely academic discipline. This is one of those rare books that will prompt its readers to re-think some of their most taken-for-granted assumptions and the ways in which those conventions bear on their everyday lives."-- Derek Gregory, The University of British Columbia <br>&nbsp;<br><br>"Denis Wood's book The Power of Maps sheds a brilliant new light on our customary experience of maps....You will never look at any map the same way again.", <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> Published On: 1992-10-18<br><br>"....The last word on maps.", <i>The Trenton Times</i> Published On: 1992-10-18<br><br>"He has some important, indeed compelling, things to say about maps...Wood not only incorporates a great store of historical detail into his essays, he sees maps as peculiar historical texts, as repositories of layers of knowledge and labor that can be revealed if we know how to read" them....I highly recommend this unconventional book to historians of science of any period.", <i>Isis</i> Published On: 1992-10-18</p><h2>The Comforts of Home: Prostitution in Colonial Nairobi</h2><p><p>"This history is . . . the first fully-fleshed story of African Nairobi in all of its complexity which foregrounds African experiences.

It enhances our understanding of African social history, political economy, and gender studies. It is a book that deserves to be widely read."&#x2014;Elizabeth Schmidt, <i>American Historical Review</i><br></p></p><p>This book is about the history of prostitution in a city in British colonial Africa. Nairobi, women saw prostitution as a reliable means of capital accumulation, not as a despicable fate or a temporary strategy. Indeed, whether a woman invested in urban real estate for herself or bought goats for her father did not seem to have been a personal or a cultural decision. The work of prostitutes was family labor.<b>Luise White </b>is professor of history at the University of Florida.

This began to change at the end of the nineteenth century when the prospect of formal training opened for women doors that had been previously closed. Nurses became respected professionals, and becoming a formally trained nurse granted women a range of new social choices and opportunities that eventually translated into economic mobility and stability. </p><p>Patricia D'Antonio looks closely at this history&#x2015;using a new analytic framework and a rich trove of archival sources&#x2015;and finds complex, multiple meanings in the individual choices of women who elected a nursing career. New relationships and social and professional options empowered nurses in constructing consequential lives, supporting their families, and participating both in their communities and in the health care system. </p><p>Narrating the experiences of nurses, D'Antonio captures the possibilities, power, and problems inherent in the different ways women defined their work and lived their lives. Scholars in the history of medicine, nursing, and public policy, those interested in the intersections of identity, work, gender, education, and race, and nurses will find this a provocative book.</p></p><p><p><b>Patricia D'Antonio</b> is an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing and the associate director of the Barbara Bates Center for the Study of the History of Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, where she is a Senior Fellow with the Leonard Davis Institute.

His was an age when literary criticism and ideas seemed to matter profoundly in the intellectual life of the country. In this eloquent book, Adam Kirsch shows that Trilling, far from being obsolete, is essential to understanding our current crisis of literary confidence&#x2014;and to overcoming it.</p><p>By reading Trilling primarily as a writer and thinker, Kirsch demonstrates how Trilling&#x2019;s original and moving work continues to provide an inspiring example of a mind creating itself through its encounters with texts. <i>Why Trilling Matters</i> introduces all of Trilling&#x2019;s major writings and situates him in the intellectual landscape of his century, from Communism in the 1930s to neoconservatism in the 1970s. But Kirsch goes deeper, addressing today&#x2019;s concerns about the decline of literature, reading, and even the book itself, and finds that Trilling has more to teach us now than ever before. As Kirsch writes, &#x201c;Trilling&#x2019;s essays are not exactly literary criticism&#x201d; but, like all literature, &#x201c;ends in themselves.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p><b>Adam Kirsch</b> is a senior editor&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<i>New Republic</i> and a columnist for <i>Tablet</i> magazine.

As Matthew Arnold served Trilling, so does Trilling serve Kirsch&#x2014;as a model of literary and humanist heroism. And though Kirsch arrives on the scene some three generations afterward, he sees into the older critic&#x2019;s complex, strenuous, yet unassuming sensibility as no one before him has succeeded in doing. <i>Why Trilling Matters</i> is a small but elastic masterwork that enlarges, with crucial immediacy, our own understanding of why literature itself must matter."&#x2014;Cynthia Ozick (Cynthia Ozick)<br><br> "This is a masterful book by a carefully attentive critic in close touch with his subject. Kirsch stresses the dialectical, experiential character of&nbsp;Trilling's writing,&nbsp;his perpetual shifting dialogue with himself and his times.&nbsp;A&nbsp;splendid and genuinely illuminating piece of work."&#x2014;Morris Dickstein, author of <i>Dancing in the Dark: A Cultural History of the Great Depression</i><br> (Morris Dickstein)<br><br>"Adam Kirsch has given us an inspiring invitation to the life of alert freedom that Lionel Trilling showed literature enables, a life of questioning the self in order to become one."&#x2014;Mark Lilla, Columbia University (Mark Lilla)<br><br>"This finely reflective reconsideration of Trilling argues persuasively for his enduring relevance, not as an interpreter of literature but as a critic forging a self through the restless engagement with literature."&#x2014;Robert Alter, author of <i>Pen of Iron: American Prose and the King James Bible</i> (Robert Alter)<br><br>&#x201c;In the compass of a short book, Kirsch manages to convey the spirit of [Trilling&#x2019;s] writings . . . giving his work the same kind of subtle and nuanced reading that Trilling gave to others.&#x201d;&#x2014;Gertrude Himmelfarb, <i>New Criterion</i> (Gertrude Himmelfarb <i>New Criterion</i>)<br><br>"In <i>Why Trilling Matters</i>, Kirsch has turned his considerable gifts to the mind he most resembles in comprehensive literary and cultural understanding. . . . Lionel Trilling, like Adam Kirsch himself, illustrates that reading deeply and wisely is not a credential for critics only, but everyone&#x2019;s last best hope of being better."&#x2014;William Giraldi, <i>The Daily Beast</i> (William Giraldi <i>The Daily Beast</i>)</p><h2>Diversity Matters: Understanding Diversity in Schools (What&#x2019;s New in Education)</h2><p>There is no single &#34;cookbook&#34; approach to working effectively with a diverse classroom population--and that&#39;s why this book is so useful.

Here are Gospel-minded pastors and scholars doing Gospel business from all the scriptures&#x2015;this is a biblical and theological feast preparing God&#x2019;s people to apply the entire Bible to all of life with heart and mind wholly committed to Christ&#x2019;s priorities.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bryan Chapell,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, Grace Presbyterian Church, Peoria, Illinois</p><p>&#x201c;Mark Twain may have smiled when he wrote to a friend, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have time to write you a short letter, so I wrote you a long letter.&#x201d; But the truth of Twain&#x2019;s remark remains serious and universal, because well-reasoned, compact writing requires extra time and extra hard work. And this is what we have in the Crossway Bible study series <em>Knowing the Bible</em>&#x2015;as the skilled authors and notable editors provide the contours of each book of the Bible as well as the grand theological themes that bind them together as one Book. Here, in a 12-week format, are carefully wrought studies that will ignite the mind and the heart.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>R. Kent Hughes,&nbsp;</strong>Senior Pastor Emeritus, College Church, Wheaton, Illinois</p><p>&#x201c;<em>Knowing the Bible</em> brings together a gifted team of Bible teachers to produce a high quality series of study guides. The coordinated focus of these materials is unique: biblical content, provocative questions, systematic theology, practical application, and the gospel story of God&#x2019;s grace presented all the way through Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;These <em>Knowing the Bible</em> volumes introduce a significant and very welcome variation on the general run of inductive Bible studies. Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A. Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T.

First published in Russian in 1884 under the title, "Candid Narratives of a Pilgrim to His Spiritual Father," this religious masterpiece recounts the adventures of an anonymous Russian pilgrim who roams the vast Siberian steppes reciting the Jesus Prayer in order to obey Christ's injunction to "pray without ceasing."<br> Apparently a wise old monk collected for posterity the captivating accounts of the pilgrim's exploits and his increasing understanding of God's providence as he commits himself to a life of prayer. The manuscript, which began to circulate privately after the pilgrim disappeared headed for Jerusalem, is reissued here in an updated translation adapted for American readers.<br> The pilgrim's charming tales and dedicated life-style are an inspirational challenge for all who would discover their own spiritual roots, pursue the contemplative life or assimilate their piety to our modern society. Many keep this unique devotional book close at hand for they have found it a comforting source of hope when they encounter trials along life's way.</p><p>A portrait of the traditions and interior life of Russian Orthodox spirituality.This translation from the Russian is in public domain and nothing seems to be available on just who R.M.

Burns examines the healing value of using metaphors in therapy and provides 101 inspirational story ideas that therapists can adapt to share with clients for effecting change. He explains how to tell stories that engage the client, how to make them metaphoric, and where to find sources for such tales. Burns also shows readers how to build stories from personal experiences or their own imagination to use in session, making this thoughtful book an especially creative therapeutic tool.<br> <br> Contains 101 stories grouped by desired therapeutic outcome, highlighting each story's applicability to a variety of presenting problems<br> <br> Offers talking points for therapists such as speci?c insights, outcomes, or skills that are illustrated by the stories<br> <br> Features shaded tabs that index stories by therapeutic outcome for easy reference and selection</p><p>"This is George Burn's best book yet. He leverages years of professional therapist experience to help individuals uncover insightful and practical solutions to the everyday life challenges encountered in the real world.

Or maybe yesterday, I don&#39;t know.&#39; In The Outsider (1942), his classic existentialist novel, Camus explores the alienation of an individual who refuses to conform to social norms. Meursault, his anti-hero, will not lie. When his mother dies, he refuses to show his emotions simply to satisfy the expectations of others. And when he commits a random act of violence on a sun-drenched beach near Algiers, his lack of remorse compounds his guilt in the eyes of society and the law. Yet he is as much a victim as a criminal. Albert Camus&#39; portrayal of a man confronting the absurd, and revolting against the injustice of society, depicts the paradox of man&#39;s joy in life when faced with the &#39;tender indifference&#39; of the world. Sandra Smith&#39;s translation, based on close listening to a recording of Camus reading his work aloud on French radio in 1954, sensitively renders the subtleties and dream-like atmosphere of L&#39;�tranger. Albert Camus (1913-1960), French novelist, essayist and playwright, is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His most famous works include The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), The Plague (1947), The Just (1949), The Rebel (1951) and The Fall (1956). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, and his last novel, The First Man, unfinished at the time of his death, appeared in print for the first time in 1994, and was published in English soon after by Hamish Hamilton. Sandra Smith was born and raised in New York City and is a Fellow of Robinson College, University of Cambridge, where she teaches French Literature and Language. She has won the French American Foundation Florence Gould Foundation Translation Prize, as well as the PEN Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize.</p><p>French novelist, essayist, and playwright.

In addition, this title features a short biography on Emily Dickinson, a chronology of the author's life, and an introductory essay written by Harold Bloom, Sterling Professor of the Humanities, Yale University.</p></p><p>Harold Bloom is Sterling Professor of Humanities, Yale University, and Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Professor of English, New York University Graduate School<p>Gr 11 Up--This series title begins with a brief biography that places the poet in the context of her times. It is followed by eight scholarly essays by renowned authors and critics such as Joyce Carol Oates, Adrienne Rich, and Allen Tate. They explore Dickinson's puritan heritage, her eccentric lifestyle, and her rank among the world's great poets. The next section consists of poetic analysis, and the final chapter is made up of eight essays that offer insights into "Dickinson's Poetic Themes." While this is not an introductory work, the volume will be a valuable aid for students seeking critical analyses of the poet's work. The scholars flatly contradict one another, which can be thought-provoking for informed readers, but may be frustrating and confusing for neophytes.</p><p><i>Marilyn (Makowski) Heath, Greenwood High School, SC</i></p><p>Copyright 1997 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Automotive Chassis Systems (Halderman Automotive Series)</h2><p><p>This book is part of the Pearson Automotive Professional Technician Series, which provides full-color, media-integrated solutions for today&#x2019;s students and instructors covering all eight areas of ASE certification, plus additional titles covering common courses.

Candid and whacky photos taken during the trip convey a generation's abandonment to drug-induced ecstasy in a way that words cannot--although words there are aplenty here. Interviews with participants and witnesses, a hybrid essay/fantasy by prankster Babbs, excerpts from Tom Wolfe 's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test attempt to capture the unruly energies of a motley but winning crew. Of most interest to serious fans of those days are the interviews by Perry (former editor of Running magazine), in which, for example, the literary origins of Kesey's band in Palo Alto--Larry McMurtry, Robert Stone, Gordon Lish, Wallace Stegner at nearby Stanford--are restored to the myth. (Stone's refusal to aggrandize the "birth of counterculture"--"Still, we were rather pleased with ourselves. . . . We kept our world small"--is a nice counterbalance to the broader claims made elsewhere.) Perry's careful reconstruction of the nine-city trip has its wonders, too, such as the meeting with a surly, intoxicated Jack Kerouac who, upon seeing a "throne" prepared for him by the Pranksters with an American flag draped over it, "mute and quiet . . . took the flag and folded it up neatly and put it over the side." <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cecilia, or Memoirs of an Heiress (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Cecilia is an heiress, but she can only keep her fortune if her husband will consent to take her surname. Fanny Burney's unusual love story and deft social satire was much admired on its first publication in 1782 for its subtle interweaving of comedy, humanity, and social analysis.<br>Controversial in its time, this eighteenth-century novel seems entirely fresh in relation to late twentieth-century concerns.</p><p>This novel is an unusual and disturbing love-story. In playing on the issue of the heroine&#39;s name, the novel illustrates the high cost of a patriarchal system. Burney exhibits her powers as a comic writer and a satirist in depicting Cecilia&#39;s dismaying entry into the gilded fashionable world. This edition presents &#39;Cecilia&#39; as it first appeared in 1782, indicating changes Burney made to later editions.Peter Sabor is Professor of English at Queen's University, Ontario.<br><br>Margaret Anne Doody is Professor of English at Princeton.</p><h2>Toward Another Shore: Russian Thinkers Between Necessity and Chance (Russian Literature and Thought Series)</h2><p>In this thought-provoking book, an internationally acclaimed scholar writes about the passion for ideology among nineteenth- and twentieth-century Russian intellectuals and about the development of sophisticated critiques of ideology by a continuing minority of Russian thinkers inspired by libertarian humanism. Aileen Kelly sets the conflict between utopian and anti-utopian traditions in Russian thought within the context of the shift in European thought away from faith in universal systems and "grand narratives" of progress toward an acceptance of the role of chance and contingency in nature and history.<br><br>In the current age, as we face the dilemma of how to prevent the erosion of faith in absolutes and final solutions from ending in moral nihilism, we have much to learn from the struggles, failures, and insights of Russian thinkers, Kelly says. Her essays&#x2015;some of them tours de force that have appeared before as well as substantial new studies of Turgenev, Herzen, and the <i>Signposts</i> debate&#x2015;illuminate the insights of Russian intellectuals into the social and political consequences of ideas of such seminal Western thinkers as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Darwin. <br><br>Russian Literature and Thought Series <br><br></p><p>In <i>Toward Another Shore</i>, British historian Aileen M. Kelly, a specialist in Russian history, posits that current attitudes toward 19th-century Russian intellectuals are the result of distortions on the part of both Soviet and Western historians. These historians were, in great part, influenced by cold war ideology, Kelly argues. Yet at a time when Russia is trying to build herself anew, it is important to clear away political revisionism and take a good look at what 19th-century thinkers might have to offer the present generation. In 17 essays written over a period of 20 years, Kelly explores the diversity of political thought that developed in the Russia of the past century. What she demonstrates is that, far from being lockstep in their philosophies (as cold war political historians tended to portray them), Russian intellectuals were, in reality, a disparate group that ranged from the extreme left to the extreme right. Far from being 20/20, hindsight is often blinkered by the seeming inexorability of events; in <i>Toward Another Shore</i>, Aileen Kelly shows that the revolution of 1917 and its resulting political system was by no means the <i>only</i> possible outcome of 19th-century Russian thought--even as late as 1909 Russian reformers were debating several different possibilities. Kelly describes and comments on these arguments with tremendous intelligence, adding valuable new insights to the study of Russian political thought.Although many of these essays are rich in insight and thought-provoking, the collection as a whole strikes me as denser than day-old black bread. -- <i><i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Michael J.

Surely, Marcus Aurelius's golden reign over the Roman Empire, A.D. 161 to A.D. 180, was such a test. Although this well-educated pagan despised wars and battles, "barbarian" tribes constantly besieged his empire on the Asian and German borders. As a result, he spent eight miserable winters camped by the frozen Danube River acting as commander-in-chief over his triumphant armies. During those gloomy nights, he wrote many of the meditations that appear in this excellent translation.<p> The lack of arrogance or self-pity in his ruminations offers proof that Aurelius passed Lincoln's test of character with flying colors. Furthermore, the best way to test a person's writing is to give it time. Once again, Aurelius aced the test. For example, contemporary world leaders would do well to heed his advice under the heading "Talking and Being": "Stop talking about what the good person should be, and just be that person." Most of these quotes are similarly brief as he extols the virtues of working hard, not acting impulsively, and living in communion with the natural world. Like Thich Nhat Hanh and Kahlil Gilbran, Marcus Aurelius is an accessible writer of lasting spiritual integrity. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Mark Forstater is a producer of films, television documentaries, audio tapes, and now books.

Equally significant is Edith Wharton the designer. Wharton is widely regarded as the inventor of the concept of interior design, both in her writings on the subject (The Decoration of Houses, published in 1897 and about to celebrate its centennial, and Italian Villas and Their Gardens, published in 1904, remain in print) and in her own residences.<br>This fascinating volume unites Wharton's personal history with discussion of her design theory, the elaborate settings she created in her fiction, and the design of her own residences, including exteriors, interiors, and gardens. Illustrated with an engaging combination of lavish new color photography and charming historical documents, it offers a unique collection that captures Wharton's timeless style.<br>Wharton's homes are exemplary of the architectural and design sensibilities she set forth in her books. Her early years were spent in Old New York, Europe, and Newport, Rhode Island. After her marriage, she and her husband lived in a Park Avenue townhouse and two Newport houses, until construction of The Mount, their grand home and grounds in Lenox, Massachusetts. Wharton's later years were spent in a Paris apartment, a house in the nearby countryside, the Pavillon Colombe, and a Riviera villa, Ste. Claire du Vieux Chateau. The extraordinary mix of Wharton own homes, the environments she created in her novels and stories, and her design theories enhances an understanding of her contributions to interior design, to literature, and to twentieth-century American design.</p><p>Theresa Craig is a professor of humanities at the New School for Social Research, where she teaches courses on Edith Wharton.</p><h2>Basics of Anesthesia: with Evolve Website (Stoelting, Basics of Anesthesia: with Evolve Website)</h2><p>Widely acknowledged as the foremost introductory text, this latest edition provides the most authoritative and complete overview of anesthesia theory and practice and continues to serve as an excellent primer on the scope and practice of anesthesiology.

The consequences of the popular rebellion and Russian President Putin&#x2019;s attempt to strangle it remain uncertain. In this book, Andrew Wilson combines a spellbinding, on-the-scene account of the Kiev Uprising with a deeply informed analysis of what precipitated the events, what has developed in subsequent months, and why the story is far from over.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wilson situates Ukraine&#x2019;s February insurgence within Russia&#x2019;s expansionist ambitions throughout the previous decade. He reveals how President Putin&#x2019;s extravagant spending to develop soft power in all parts of Europe was aided by wishful thinking in the EU and American diplomatic inattention, and how Putin&#x2019;s agenda continues to be widely misunderstood in the West. The author then examines events in the wake of the Uprising&#x2014;the military coup in Crimea, the election of President Petro Poroshenko, the Malaysia Airlines tragedy, rising tensions among all of Russia's neighbors, both friend and foe, and more. <i>Ukraine Crisis</i> provides an important, accurate record of events that unfolded in Ukraine in 2014.

Everyone at Appleyard College for Young Ladies agreed it was just right for a picnic at Hanging Rock. After lunch, a group of three of the girls climbed into the blaze of the afternoon sun, pressing on through the scrub into the shadows of Hanging Rock. Further, higher, till at last they disappeared.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never returned. Whether <i><b>Picnic at Hanging Rock</b></i> is fact or fiction the reader must decide for themselves.</p><p>Joan Lindsay was born in Melbourne, where she went to school as a day-girl for a few years at Clyde Girls Grammar, then situated in East St Kilda. Appleyard College, the setting oh her most famous novel Picnic at Hanging Rock, was to some extent based on Clyde Girls&#39; Grammar School. From 1916 to 1919, Joan studied painting at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School, Melbourne and exhibited numerous of her watercolor and oil paintings. On Valentine&#39;s Day 1922 she married Daryl Lindsay in London. When her husband was knighted in 1956 and Joan became Lady Lindsay. The Lindsays travelled together in Europe and the USA, Daryl with his paints and Joan with her typewriter. She contributed articles, reviews and stories to various magazines and newspapers on art. She died in December 1984.&#34;This deliciously horrific Australian thriller, set in 1900, could be seen as an anti-picnic cautionary tale.&#34; * Observer * &#34;Written in a beautifully haunting style that drew me in.&#34; -- Esther McKay * Sun Herald (Australia) * &#34;A sinister tale...laced with touches of other-worldliness&#34; * Guardian *</p><h2>Where is Thumbkin?: 500 Activities to Use with Songs You Already Know</h2><p>Sing over 200 familiar songs and learn new songs set to familiar tunes.

By 1964 the Pentagon was certain those men had been killed, captured, or "turned" to work for the North and began sending new agents north. Dubbed Operation Plan 34-Alpha, this renewed effort was part of a shadowy covert action force known as the Studies and Observations Group (SOG). By 1968 some five hundred agents had been lost in the North. Their families were told they were dead by SOG officials, who did nothing to determine their whereabouts or seek their return. Twenty years later more than three hundred of those agents were released from North Vietnamese prisons, and Washington's darkest secret was uncovered. Using recently declassified government files as well as personal interviews with the Vietnamese commandos and CIA and SOG participants, former army intelligence officer and Defense Intelligence Agency analyst Sedgwick Tourison unravels for the first time the tragically flawed and costly operation that helped trigger - deliberately, most believe - the Vietnam War.<br>Shunned by the U.S. government, the surviving former commandos, some imprisoned for up to thirty years, tell remarkably similar stories. Their teams were often met by North Vietnamese soldiers at supposedly secret drop zones and executed or imprisoned, with many being forced to broadcast disinformation to their U.S. handlers. Stunning testimony by former CIA and SOG officials interviewed by the author reveals that the agent drops continued for years after it was known the program had been compromised.<br>Were they deliberately used by U.S. intelligence officials as bait to push Hanoi into war and later to test U.S. communications security, or were they merely victims of a successful North Vietnamese counterintelligence operation?</p><p></p><h2>Counseling and Educational Research: Evaluation and Application</h2><p>The <b>Third Edition</b> of <b>Counseling and Educational Research: Evaluation and Application </b>emphasizes the importance of being a good consumer of research and teaches readers how to conduct research in practice.

Called the Know Nothings, they started riots during elections, tarred and feathered their political enemies, and barred men from employment based on their religion. The group that caused this uproar?: Irish and German Catholics&#x2015;then known as the most villainous religious group in America, and widely believed to be loyal only to the Pope. It would take another hundred years before Catholics threw off these xenophobic accusations and joined the American mainstream. The idea that the United States is a stronghold of religious freedom is central to our identity as a nation&#x2015;and utterly at odds with the historical record. In <i>American Heretics</i>, historian Peter Gottschalk traces the arc of American religious discrimination and shows that, far from the dominant protestant religions being kept in check by the separation between church and state, religious groups from Quakers to Judaism have been subjected to similar patterns of persecution. Today, many of these same religious groups that were once regarded as anti-thetical to American values are embraced as evidence of our strong religious heritage&#x2015;giving hope to today's Muslims, Sikhs, and other religious groups now under fire.</p><p>Peter Gottschalk is the chair of the Religion department at Wesleyan University. He is the co-author of the scholarly text <i>Islamophobia: Making Muslims the Enemy</i>, which examines the depiction of Muslims in political cartoons.

Peter Gottschalk's American Heretics is a unique and powerful study and critique, a corrective to many American's amnesia about our past history of religious intolerance and, in his last chapter, a wakeup call to 'The Sum of All Fears: Islamophobia and Anti-Muslim Sentiment.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>John L. Esposito, author of The Future of Islam and Islamophobia and the Challenge of Pluralism.</i></p><p>&#x201c;American Heretics is a heartfelt plea to Americans to take responsibility for their xenophobia and racism.

Was he criticizing the worldview of the conservative aesthete, Pavel Kirsanov, and the older generation, or that of the radical, cerebral medical student, Evgenii Bazarov, representing the younger one? The critic Dmitrii Pisarev wrote at the time that the novel &#34;stirs the mind . . . because everything is permeated with the most complete and most touching sincerity.&#34; N. N. Strakhov, a close friend of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, praised its &#34;profound vitality.&#34; It is this profound vitality in Turgenev&#39;s characters that carry his novel of ideas to its rightful place as a work of art and as one of the classics of Russian Literature.Ivan Turgenev (1818-1883) was a Russian novelist, short story writer, and playwright whose novel Fathers and Sons is regarded as one of the major works of nineteenth-century fiction.<br><br>Sean Runnette, a multiple AudioFile Earphones Award winner, has also produced several Audie Award-winning audiobooks.

As Jones reveals, some of the best-loved devices of our shared social media language are a result of Black women&#x2019;s innovations, from well-known movement-building hashtags (#BlackLivesMatter, #SayHerName, and #BlackGirlMagic) to the now ubiquitous use of threaded tweets as a marketing and storytelling tool. For some, these online dialogues provide an introduction to the work of Black feminist icons like Angela Davis, Barbara Smith, bell hooks, and the women of the Combahee River Collective. For others, this discourse provides a platform for continuing their feminist activism and scholarship in a new, interactive way.<br><br>Complex conversations around race, class, and gender that have been happening behind the closed doors of academia for decades are now becoming part of the wider cultural vernacular&#x2014;one pithy tweet at a time.

Often they do not know that they are singing spirituals. They associate them with their churches, schools, camps, or clubs and are surprised when told that they are singing spirituals. <br>"Almost a thousand of these songs have been collected since the end of the Civil War. They are unique in the song literature of the world and are considered America's most distinctive contribution to world music." <br>Of the thousand African-American spirituals that are known, Mr. Bryan has here chosen twenty, among them some of the best known and best loved, including the title song, "All Night, All Day," and such others as "This Little Light of Mine,""When the Saints Go Marching In," and "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands." For each, David Manning Thomas has created an interesting piano accompaniment in support of the melody and has indicated guitar chords. Best of all, full-color pictures capture the spirit and essence of many of the songs to make this a book that can both be used as a fine songbook and treasured for its beauty; for the warmth, liveliness, and inspirational depth of its illustrations.</p><p>Unique to the world of music and admired for their richly emotional content, African-American spirituals receive the celebration they deserve in this collection of songs for young children. Old favorites such as "O When the Saints Go Marching In" and "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" are coupled with lesser-known titles such as the collection's namesake, "All Night, All Day." All of the songs are stirring and inspirational when sung by young children. They come with guitar and piano accompaniments, as well as warmly hued, free-flowing illustrations of natural forms--waves, leaves, flower petals, stars--that suggest a feeling of radiance and hope. <b>All Night, All Day</b> won the Coretta Scott King Award for 1992.Ashley Bryan grew up to the sound of his mother singing from morning to night, and he has shared the joy of song with children ever since.

Where does that journey begin? High in the sky, rain clouds are parting. Water trickles and flows down the mountain, collecting in an upland bog, seeping through a beaver&#x2019;s dam, rushing over rocks, passing many plants and animals along its winding way&#x2014;each dependent on water and the different environments it shapes to live. Author and illustrator Gordon Morrison has captured a single moment in time, revealing the course and influence of water, and inviting readers to pause and consider the world around them in this beautiful and lyrical appreciation of nature and the resource that makes it all possible&#x2014;a drop of water.</p><p>Gordon Morrison is a well-known naturalist whose work has been praised by Roger Tory Peterson as "Marvelous, beautiful, excellent . . . Morrison&#x2019;s work is so inspiring that I wish such clear material was available when I was slowly learning ecology. . . . We owe a debt of gratitude to Gordon for his interpretive skills as an artist. He is a superb teacher who uses visual methods." Robert Bateman likened his work to that of Albrecht Durer and Andrew Wyeth. Gordon Morrison makes his home in Massachusetts.K-Gr. 3. The latest picture book by the writer-illustrator of <i>Nature in the Neighborhood</i> (2004) follows the downhill path of rainwater. "A child's finger is wet with water from a meadow brook." On a nearby mountaintop, rainwater flows into a stream that falls over a cliff, through a mountain pool and an upland bog, past a beavers' dam, through a lowland swamp and a meadow marsh, and past the child who crouches by the brook. Each double-page spread opens on a new scene, deftly illustrated in pencil drawings that are brightened with colors to highlight portions of the picture. The few lines of text per spread point out examples of plants and animals in the illustrations. Though some children will find the quiet, ever-informative text soporific, others may enjoy looking for the specific animals and plants named there. Appended notes with thumbnail pencil illustrations offer help in identifying the species mentioned. Though the large-scale, close-up cover art will appeal to preschoolers, the landscape pictures inside are better suited to an older audience. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

David Abulafia&#39;s The Great Sea is the first complete history of the Mediterranean, from the erection of temples on Malta around 3500 BC to modern tourism. Ranging across time and the whole extraordinary space of the Mediterranean from Gibraltar to Jaffa, Genoa to Tunis, and bringing to life pilgrims, pirates, sultans and naval commanders, this is the story of the sea that has shaped much of world history.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> In this expansive yet detailed historical gem, David Abulafia covers the full course of human history on the Mediterranean. Beginning more than 20,000 years ago with Cro-Magnon cave dwellers on Gibraltar and stretching to the present, Abulafia treats the Great Sea as &#x201c;the Liquid Continent,&#x201d; a place peopled and traveled&#x2014;where trade, cultural exchange, and empire-building were forces as key to life as currents, tides, and weather patterns. The book deftly illustrates how the Mediterranean was always big enough to keep cultures apart, thus allowing them the space to flourish as unique entities, but that it was never so big that differing cultures couldn&#x2019;t interact. The result is an epic story of trade and conflict, showing how differences in language, religion, law, and other human flashpoints sparked so much of what we think of today simply as <em>culture</em>. --<em>Chris Schluep</em> <p></p> <strong><br>Amazon Exclusive: Author Q&amp;A with David Abulafia</strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author David Abulafia</td> </tr> <tr> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What role did Greek mythology and Homeric poetry play in creating a lasting conception of the Mediterranean?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The seas described in Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> are a strange amalgam of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, of east and west. Circe the sorceress seems to live in the east, where the sun rises, while Scylla and Charybdis are often identified with the straits between Sicily and mainland Italy.</p> <p>Despite those muddles, Homer does provide fascinating testimony to knowledge of the seas among the Greek colonists in Ionia (what is now eastern Turkey), whose dialect was the basis of Homeric Greek. He knew about Phoenician sailors and was not very complimentary about them. Above all, he placed Odysseus' kingdom at the western limits of Greece, on Ithaka, which he portrayed as an island where it was natural to know how to handle boats. What we see is a dawning conception of the extent of the Mediterranean and of the importance of the sea to the early Greeks.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Beyond the historical, military significance of the Mediterranean, what happened culturally that we tend to overlook?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The Mediterranean has been a meeting place of many different ethnic and religious groups, inhabiting its shores and islands--in remote antiquity, Greeks, Etruscans, Phoenicians; in later centuries, Jews, Christians and Muslims. Gathering in the port cities around the Mediterranean, such as ancient Marseilles, medieval Palermo and Alexandria, modern Livorno and Smyrna, these groups have interacted not just at the level of high culture but in everyday life. On the one hand you have the transmission of medical and astronomical knowledge from east to west in the Middle Ages, often via Muslim and Christian Spain, and on the other hand you have the peaceful interaction of traders and sailors doing business and respecting one another in the great ports of the Mediterranean. Often they were able to cross the boundaries between warring competitors for control of the sea, moving between Christian and Muslim lands under the protection of local rulers.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Americans and Europeans have vastly different conceptions of the Mediterranean Sea, with most Americans thinking of the Sea and its shores primarily for its appeal as a tourist destination. What role, if any, has the Mediterranean had in shaping the United States?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The American involvement in the Mediterranean at the start of the nineteenth century is a fascinating story--not just an episode but something that decisively altered the Mediterranean world. By defeating the rulers of the Barbary regencies (Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli), who detained their trading ships and sailors and demanded extortionate sums of money for their release, the American navy helped clear the Mediterranean of the five-century-long scourge of piracy. This was the first foreign war of the United States after independence, and it was now that the U.S. Navy came into existence. In the 20th century, the strategic significance of the Mediterranean in the Cold War brought the U.S.A.F. to Wheelus airfield in Libya and the conflict between Israel and its neighbors has also brought the U.S. Navy into the Mediterranean. Strategically, the Mediterranean has remained important to the U.S., as we see from the latest events in Libya.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will the Mediterranean continue to play a key role in the global economy of the 21st century?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Much depends on the relationship between northern and southern Europe, and between Europe and North Africa. With the Greek economy in desperate straits and the Italian and Spanish economies under severe strain, and with the Arab countries in turmoil, there is a big question mark over the assumption that rapid economic growth will continue in the region. One solution may be to build closer bonds between northern and southern Mediterranean countries, including free trade concessions to Tunisia and Libya. Tunisia possessed the strongest economy in Africa and it would be a disaster to ignore its great economic potential. Another question arises over Chinese investment and involvement in the Mediterranean, which has begun to accumulate. So we are looking at a particularly uncertain future.</p>David Abulafia is Professor of Mediterranean History at the University of Cambridge, and a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, and was until recently Chairman of the Cambridge History Faculty.

The book includes Shamus nominee Ardai's choices of the 10 best Black Widower stories, six previously uncollected tales and more. In each tale, the six members of the Black Widowers club gather to dine, socialize and take a crack at solving a puzzle posed by an invited guest. Invariably, the highly literate and intelligent group-an artist, a patent lawyer, a cryptographer, a math teacher, a chemist and a mystery writer (whose real-life counterparts from Asimov's circle of science-fiction colleagues Harlan Ellison identifies in his foreword)-falls short of success, and their Jeeves-like waiter, Henry, effortlessly points out the often obvious clues they overlooked. The mysteries the club tackles range from murder to theft to the seemingly inexplicable disappearance of an umbrella into a space warp. Most are locked-room or impossible crimes, and since the author bends over backwards to play fair, many readers will easily be able to anticipate the solutions.

The Tocquevilles inherited a title gained long ago by military prowess; an ancestor had taken part in William the Conqueror&#x2019;s invasion of England. On the maternal side were judges and civil servants, ennobled more recently for professional service to the Crown. Alexis&#x2019;s mother Louise&#x2019;s grandfather was the truly distinguished Chr�tien-Guillaume de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, who as official censor in the mid-eighteenth century had worked to protect great writers such as Voltaire and Rousseau, and who said he spent his whole life &#x201c;in what would be called in other countries the opposition party.&#x201d; Malesherbes died at the guillotine, punished for loyally serving as defense counsel when his king was on trial for his life. Alexis honored his memory and thought of him as an inspiring role model, not least in resisting the seductions of power.Malesherbes was not the only relative who was executed, and Alexis, who was born in 1805, grew up hearing frightening stories of how the revolutionary idealism of 1789 degenerated four years later into the cruel Reign of Terror, when Robespierre&#x2019;s dreaded Committee of Public Safety ordered the execution of thousands of &#x201c;counterrevolutionaries&#x201d; (historians believe the total may have been as high as forty thousand). Many members of Tocqueville&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s family were beheaded, and she and his father, Herv�, survived only because three days before they were scheduled to die, the implacable Robespierre and his allies were overthrown by a coup. When Herv�, who was twenty at the time, emerged from prison, his hair had gone completely white, and Louise was afflicted with mental illness for the rest of her life. From her Alexis inherited fluctuations of mood and emotional sensitivity&#x2014;he has been called a repressed romantic&#x2014;and from Herv� he got an energetic and impulsive temperament. As he once told his brother �douard, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s that restlessness of mind, that consuming impatience, that need for repeated lively sensations that our father has, sometimes to a rather childish degree. This disposition gives great �lan at certain times, but most of the time it torments without cause, agitates fruitlessly, and makes those who possess it very unhappy.&#x201d;Alexis was far more promising than his two older brothers, with whom he always maintained affectionate relations. Hippolyte, the eldest, had a not very successful military career and then an unremarkable one in the civil service; the middle brother, �douard, left the army to marry an heiress and devoted himself thereafter to running his estate. Young Alexis, meanwhile, was educated at home by a kindly but not very demanding old priest named the abb� Christian Lesueur, who had been his father&#x2019;s tutor before him. By the time Alexis was ten years old, he had been exposed to a good deal of history at first hand. His father took him to Paris to witness the celebration after Napoleon&#x2019;s defeat at Waterloo, and he wrote to his tutor, &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you come with us? How you would have shouted &#x2018;Vive le roi!&#x2019; &#x201d; Soon afterward they were granted a formal audience with the newly restored monarch, Louis XVIII.Under that king and his successor, the inept Charles X, Herv� de Tocqueville held a series of positions in which he served as an active and imaginative administrator, developing modernizing programs in agriculture, transportation, and education. But he was very much an aristocrat of the old school, sympathetic to extreme royalists who wanted the ancien r�gime restored to its old privileges. His two eldest sons shared his convictions; Alexis did not.Alexis spent his childhood in Normandy, where his family had its roots, and in Paris, until 1817, when he was twelve years old and his way of life changed dramatically. His father was appointed prefect, or governor, of the Moselle region in eastern France, with headquarters at Metz. He sent for Alexis and placed him in the first school he had ever attended, where he immediately excelled. Most important, liberated from the tutelage of the lovable but deeply conservative Lesueur, Alexis learned to think for himself. He began devouring books by eighteenth-century skeptics in his father&#x2019;s library, and at sixteen he experienced a shattering loss of religious faith that still haunted him when he described it to a confidante thirty-five years later: &#x201c;Then doubt entered my soul, or rather it rushed in with incredible violence, not just doubt about this or that, but universal doubt. Suddenly I experienced the sensation that people who have been through an earthquake describe, the ground shaking beneath their feet, the walls around them, the ceiling above them, the furniture they&#x2019;re touching, the whole of nature before their eyes. I was seized by the blackest melancholy, and by extreme disgust for life without even knowing life yet, and I was overwhelmed with distress and terror at the sight of the road that lay ahead of me in the world.&#x201d;What rescued him were his earliest sexual adventures. &#x201c;Violent passions pulled me out of this state of despair, and turned my gaze away from these mental ruins and toward sensory objects.&#x201d; (After his death his widow considered this confession so shocking that she got Beaumont, who had been collecting his friend&#x2019;s correspondence, to return it to her, and she destroyed it. It survives only because Beaumont&#x2019;s wife was so struck by it that she surreptitiously made a copy.) Tocqueville was handsome, charming, and appealing to women, but virtually nothing is known about his early relationships. One of his biographers, however, discovered the birth certificate of a child born of a transient union with a servant, and at about the same time Tocqueville had a passionate affair with a middle-class girl whom his patrician family would never have accepted for his spouse. A remarkable letter survives from his cousin and lifelong friend Louis de Kergorlay, written in 1823, when Alexis was seventeen, which contrasts their erotic temperaments. &#x201c;I see that you catch fire suddenly, like gunpowder,&#x201d; Kergorlay said, &#x201c;and that the important thing is not to put a match to you. With me it&#x2019;s completely different. It&#x2019;s a subdued, confused, and habitual feeling that never leaves me, and tickles me quite apart from any objects that arouse it, which is to say, this or that woman. I feel less unbridled lust than you do, and more love . . . But since, unlike yours, my soul has more to do with this than my body does, I&#x2019;m far more demanding. I&#x2019;m waiting for the woman who will be right for me, the way the Jews await the Messiah.&#x201d; What prompted Kergorlay&#x2019;s rather preachy letter (he was only eighteen himself) was not just a high-minded resolve to remain pure until marriage, but a hint Alexis had dropped that he was planning to fight a duel over an affair of honor. It is not known whether the duel ever took place, but if it did, perhaps his father, the prefect, hushed it up.As for the religious doubts, they troubled Tocqueville for the rest of his life. In a rather abstract way he continued to be, or wanted to be, a believer, but more accurately he was an agnostic lamenting the loss of the faith of his earliest years. One of his favorite authors was Pascal, whose Pens�es spoke eloquently to his dread of emptiness and to his compulsion to be always active. &#x201c;Nothing is so intolerable to man,&#x201d; Pascal wrote, &#x201c;as to be completely at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without work. He then feels his nothingness, his desertion, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. Immediately from the depth of his heart will emerge ennui, gloom, sadness, distress, vexation, despair.&#x201d; For someone with Tocqueville&#x2019;s volatile temperament, intellectual labor would become a lifelong escape from anxiety and doubt; as Beaumont said, &#x201c;Mental activity was like a sanctum for him, in which he took refuge to escape the unrest and sorrows of the soul.&#x201d; A few years after Tocqueville&#x2019;s death the American Charles Eliot Norton wrote that he &#x201c;was born a thinker . . . his mind was large and calm.&#x201d; The wisdom and calm were hard-won.When his school studies were finished, Tocqueville moved in with his mother in Paris&#x2014;she had refused to go to Metz&#x2014;and began to study law. He found the subject arid and tedious, but he stuck with it for two years and got his degree. For relief he made a two-week tour of Sicily with his brother �douard, and on the trip he kept a huge notebook (now mostly lost) that would turn out to be a trial run for his note taking in America five years later.Herv� de Tocqueville was transferred twice after his stint in Metz, the second time to Versailles, and in 1827 he got his twenty-two-year-old son appointed as an unsalaried juge-auditeur, or apprentice magistrate, there. Alexis found the work unexpectedly stimulating, though he was rather startled by his own competitiveness, and frustrated by his awkwardness as a speaker. He wrote to his cousin Kergorlay, who was an army officer by then, &#x201c;I recognize daily that I have a need to come out on top that is going to torment me cruelly all my life. And I have another defect at present: I&#x2019;m having a hard time getting used to speaking in public. I grope for words and cut my ideas short. I see people all around me who reason badly and speak well, and that puts me in a continual rage.&#x201d;It might seem that Alexis had chosen the wrong profession altogether, since he told Kergorlay that he had no intention of becoming &#x201c;a legal machine&#x201d; like his pedantic colleagues. B...</p><h2>Chesapeake Bay Log Canoes and Bugeyes</h2><p>For generations, vessels built on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay have been famous among seafaring peoples of Europe and America. In Maryland and Virginia, the two states which confine the bay, the master shipwrights have always been experimental designers of sturdy vessels for use wherever speed has been the prime requirement. Some, like the Baltimore clipper, have become world famous. Little note has been made, however, of other types of craft, even though their utility and length of service have been considerably longer. This volume redresses that oversight. Brewington traces the history of log canoes and bugeyes, providing meticulous descriptions of the hulls, rigging, fittings, and specialized equipment used on these unique bay craft. The plates give lines and sail plans for more than a score of specific vessels. This combined edition of Chesapeake Bay Log Canoes, first published in 1937, and Chesapeake Bay Bugeyes, first published in 1941, is a revised and enlarged version. Its publication has been made possible through the cooperation of The Mariners&#39; Museum, Newport News, Virginia.</p><p>M. V. Brewington (1902-1974) was a native of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, as were his forebears who settled there in 1669. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, he followed his family footsteps into the banking business, but during collegiate summers, he shipped out to sea. His lifelong interest in the sea and seafaring became his career and hobby. His expertise in maritime history led to wartime and postwar appointments as a librarian and cataloguer of historical records for the U.S. Navy. Brewington&#39;s outstanding career in maritime history includes becoming the maritime curator of the Maryland Historical Society, assistant director and curator of Maritime History at the Peabody Museum of Salem, and trustee or overseer of several other maritime institutions, including the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michaels. He was among the founders and editorial advisors of The American Neptune. In addition, M.V. Brewington wrote a number of articles and books, including Chesapeake Bay Log Canoes and Bugeyes.</p><h2>Dinner at Aunt Connie&#39;s House</h2><p>Dinner at Aunt Connie&#39;s is even more special than usual when Melody meets not only her new adopted cousin but twelve inspiring African-American women, who step out of their portraits and join the family for dinner.</p><p>Kindergarten-Grade 4-A highly imaginative and original picture book filled with stunning artwork. Unfortunately, the blending of fact and fantasy just does not work here. Melody meets her newly adopted cousin, Lonnie, at her Aunt Connie's house one summer. While playing, the youngsters discover 12 paintings in the attic, each of which depicts a famous African-American woman. What is unusual about the portraits is that they can speak. Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer, Mary McLeod Bethune, Zora Neale Hurston, and the others take turns telling their stories to the two astonished children. At this point, the story gets bogged down by too many pages of biographical information. Plot elements of a family dinner, Lonnie's adoption, and his unusual features could themselves serve as rich story lines for separate books. Beautifully illustrated in the artist's trademark folk style, the book has a profusion of bright and vibrant colors of bold reds, yellows, and blues and muted purples, mauves, and beiges. The human figures are large and blocklike, with rich brown skin color. In the final analysis, Ringgold has tried to do too much. Nonetheless, despite these failings, this offering provides information, has charm, and is visually powerful.<br><i> Carol Jones Collins, Montclair Kimberley Academy, NJ</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Melody loves the annual family excursion to Aunt Connie's house: everyone gets to go swimming, share a fabulous dinner and see an exhibition of Aunt Connie's most recent art. This year there are surprises as well: a newly adopted cousin her own age ("I fell in love with him the first time I saw him") and a series of paintings of famous African American women. From their frames on the wall, the pictured women tell of their devotion to civil rights (Rosa Parks and Fannie Lou Hamer), education (Mary McLeod Bethune), literature (Zora Neale Hurston) and other causes and professions. Ringgold's ( Tar Beach ) distinctive primitive style, with its thick strokes and resilient, varied colors, seems especially suited to portraying these women of exceptional substance and strength. The heart of the book--the pages in which the women tell their stories--is at once a magical and a ringing affirmation of their achievements. But the surrounding pages are less impressive. Neither the members of Melody's extended family nor the dinner itself ever seem real, much less "extra special," and the book concludes on an odd, gratuitously sentimental note as the two children discuss their future as a married couple years hence.

The company packages football as a visceral and dramatic sequence of violent, beautiful, graceful, and heroic gridiron battles. Historically proven formulas for presentation--such as the dramatic voiceovers once provided by John Facenda's baritone, the soaring scores of Sam Spence's rousing background music, and the epic poetry found in Steve Sabol's scripts--are still used today.<br> &nbsp;<br> From the Vincent Price-narrated <i>Strange but True Football Stories</i> to the currently running series<i> Hard Knocks</i>, NFL Films distinguishes the NFL from other sports organizations and from other media and entertainment.

Learn more at CarlaNeggers.com.Clare Morgan hadn't felt this happy in a long time. A <i>very</i> long time, she thought as she gathered up books to take to Rivendell, the local assisted-living facility. She prided herself on her self-sufficiency and independence&#x2014;her professionalism as a librarian&#x2014;and she was happy in countless ways, but this was different. This was happiness born of contentment. The uncertainties of the past few months were lifting and confidence settling in that she'd made the right decision to leave Boston and come to out-of-the-way Knights Bridge, Massachusetts.<br><br>New to the town and its small, charming library, Clare was getting a feel for the reading preferences of the seniors at Rivendell. Audrey Frost liked cozy mysteries, particularly ones set in England. Grace Webster would read anything but was partial to literary fiction and classic adventure novels. Arthur Potter had asked Clare to bring him all the Harry Potter books, since he and Harry shared the same last name and he'd always wanted to be a wizard. Daisy Farrell, Rivendell's newest resident, had requested <i>A Christmas Carol,</i> the classic Dickens story apparently a favorite with her and her late husband.<br><br>Almost everyone at the facility was widowed, but Clare gathered that many had enjoyed long marriages.<br><br>Except one feisty woman in her late eighties whose name Clare had forgotten. "I've never lived alone until four years, three months and eighteen days ago," she'd said when Clare had delivered her a stack of biographies. "It's heaven on earth."<br><br>Clare was a widow herself, but she wasn't sure how many people in her new town were aware that she'd been married. She had enjoyed the entire one year, two months and three days of her marriage to Stephen Morgan. Every single second had been bliss&#x2014;including the inevitable arguments. That he'd been gone for six years seemed inconceivable. But every day she saw him in Owen, their six-year-old son, born seven weeks after his father's untimely death in a car accident.<br><br>She put the books in a box, careful not to overfill it and make it impossible to carry. The seniors also had several book clubs that met both at Rivendell and at the library. Vera Galeski, a part-time worker at the library, had taken Clare through the various book clubs. Her predecessor as library director, Phoebe O'Dunn, born and raised in Knights Bridge, had run a tight ship. She'd left Clare with a balanced budget and a well-trained group of volunteers, among them several mobile residents of the assisted-living facility.<br><br>She checked her watch. Three o'clock. Owen, a first-grader, would be walking from school soon to play with Aidan and Tyler Sloan at their house. So far, Owen was adjusting well to his new school. It had only been six weeks since his and Clare's arrival in Knights Bridge, and she expected bumps in the road&#x2014;but small ones, especially compared to the huge one of losing Stephen. Owen, of course, didn't remember his father. He was a photo in an album, part of funny stories Clare told about life before he was born.<br><br>Stephen had been the love of her life. It wasn't something she told her young son, but she didn't hide it, either.<br><br>She got on with her work. She went out the heavy front door and took the ramp instead of the stairs. In anticipation of the run out to Rivendell, she'd parked on South Main in front of the library, a sturdy mostly brick building donated to the town in 1872 by George Sanderson, whose stern portrait hung above the fireplace in the main sitting room. As far as Clare knew, there were no Sandersons left in Knights Bridge.<br><br>She hit the button on her key fob to unlock the car doors. She popped the trunk, setting the box inside next to ice skates she'd found at a secondhand sports store in Amherst, a nearby college town. Owen desperately wanted to learn to ice skate. He insisted six was old enough. Every winter for the past fifty-plus years, the town had created an outdoor rink on the common. It was an "at your own risk" operation, with no supervision, no walls to grab hold of&#x2014;not even a proper place to warm up. Hypothermia and frostbite were real concerns in a New England winter.<br><br>Clare put the brakes on her litany of concerns. <i>Questions,</i> she told herself. Not worries. She wasn't a panicky, overprotective mother and didn't want to become one. She was asking appropriate questions and taking appropriate precautions without turning either Owen or herself into chronic fretters.<br><br>But she'd been on South Main last week when two teenage boys had collided, requiring Band-Aids and a lot of cursing if not a trip to the ER and stitches.<br><br><i>Still...</i><br><br>Clare got in her car. Bringing books to the seniors at Rivendell was one of the easy, low-tech, low-stress parts of her job, and she loved it.<br><br>She glanced back at the library. It was decked out with twin wreaths on the front door, swags of greenery around the windows and a trio of grapevine reindeer next to the steps. Tasteful and festive. Decorating for the holidays was a long-standing tradition in Knights Bridge. According to the trustees of the Knights Bridge Free Public Library, most of the decorations, accumulated over decades, had succumbed to a roof leak last winter, but many had been in need of discarding or replacing. Few were missed. The library had its secrets, but not many treasures. By the time Clare started work, volunteers had already dived in to create new decorations, particularly with natural materials. Except for one anemic-looking grapevine reindeer, the results were impressive, and she and Owen had plans to rehabilitate the reindeer.<br><br>She turned off South Main at the end of the oblongshaped common onto the main road out to the highway. Freshly fallen snow added to the festive atmosphere. What could be more perfect than Christmas in her small New England town?<br><br>This would be her and Owen's best Christmas ever, Clare thought, smiling as she drove on the winding road.<br><br>Knights Bridge's only assisted-living facility was located in a beautiful spot with views of snow-covered meadows that gave way to woods. In the distance, Clare could see a sliver of water, not yet frozen over, that she knew to be part of Quabbin, a vast reservoir built in the 1930s by the damming of the Swift River. Many of the elderly residents of Rivendell knew people who'd lived in the valley, or had lived there themselves, before its four small towns had been taken over by the state and disincorporated, their entire populations forced to relocate.<br><br>The "accidental wilderness," Quabbin was called now, with its protected waters and watershed. On a previous visit to Rivendell, Grace Webster, a retired teacher and avid bird-watcher, had told Clare about the return of bald eagles to the valley.<br><br>She grabbed the box of books and headed inside, setting the box on a chest-high wall unit in the corridor. She waved to the receptionist, who was expecting the delivery, but the young woman was dealing with a man in expensive-looking dark brown cords and a canvas shirt, its sleeves rolled up to his elbows, as he visibly tried to control his impatience. "Her name is Daisy Farrell," he said. "She's your newest resident. She's in good health for a woman in her eighties, but I want to review her care with your medical staff."<br><br>"Of course," the flustered receptionist said. "I'm sorry. I didn't realize today's moving day for Mrs. Farrell. I only just got in."<br><br>He calmed down. "Thank you."<br><br><i>One of those imperious, successful men who likes to get his way,</i> Clare thought as she worked a sore muscle in her arm from carrying the heavy box. She would bet the man wasn't from Knights Bridge. Why was he interested in Daisy Farrell? Clare pushed her questions aside. It didn't matter. Whatever his reasons for being here, she doubted he'd ever show up again.<br><br>The man left the receptionist to fulfill his request and seemed to notice Clare for the first time. He glanced at the books in the box. "That's quite a range of titles."<br><br>"It's quite a range of people who live here." She didn't manage to keep the starch out of her voice.<br><br>If he noticed, he didn't pay any attention. "No doubt. Are you from the library?"<br><br>"Clare Morgan. I'm the new library director."<br><br>"Nice to meet you, Clare. I'm Logan Farrell. Daisy Farrell&#x2014;the woman I was biting off the poor receptionist's head over&#x2014;is my grandmother." He breathed deeply. "It's harder than I thought to move her in here."<br><br>Clare noticed a nick on his hand and bits of cardboard on his shirt. She also noticed the muscles in his forearms. He had short-cropped dark hair, hazel eyes and a strong jaw&#x2014;strong features in general, perhaps part of the reason she'd misread him. She knew better than to judge people, given her work and her natural disposition. Logan Farrell might be impatient and even arrogant, but he was here with his aging grandmother.<br><br>"She could use a cheerful book to read," he added.<br><br>Clare smiled. "I'm sure that can be arranged. She requested <i>A Christmas Carol."</i><br><br>"I don't know how cheerful the ghost ofJacob Mar-ley is. Scared the hell out of me as a kid. Have you met my grandmother?"<br><br>"Not yet."<br><br>"She has a house on Knights Bridge common and used to walk to the library, but she hasn't been out much since she took a fall in November." Logan glanced at the nick on his hand, as if noticing it for the first time. "I can introduce you if you'd like."<br><br>Even if the offer was to assuage his guilt at getting caught being impatient with the receptionist, Clare accepted. "I'd love to meet Mrs. Farrell," she said.<br><br>Daisy Farrell's grandson was clearly out of his element in a small-town assisted-living facility, talking to the local librarian. As Clare followed him down the hall, she wondered what kind of work he did and where he lived. Boston? Hartford? Somewhere farther afield&#x2014;had he flown in to visit his widowed grandmother?<br><br>The door was open to a small apartment, where an elderly white-haired woman was standing on a chair, hammer in hand. She had on baggy yoga pants, a pink hoodie and silver sneakers.<br><br>Logan sucked in an audible breath. "Gran," he said. "What are you doing?"<br><br>"Hanging my sampler."<br><br>Clare noticed a cross-stitched sampler on a chest of drawers. Neatly stitched flowers and farm animals created a frame for the simple inscription:<br><br><i>The only way to have a friend is to be one.</i><br><br>Daisy Farrell in a nutshell, Clare suspected.<br><br>"I can hang the sampler for you, Gran." Logan put a hand out. "Come on."<br><br>She grinned at him. "Getting up here was easy. I figured I'd need help getting down."<br><br>"Had a plan, did you?"<br><br>"Enough of one. Let me finish and&#x2014;"<br><br>"We have company," he said. "We can finish in a few minutes."<br><br>She sighed. "All right, all right."<br><br>He took her hammer and helped her down from the chair. "Gran, this is Clare Morgan, the new librarian in town. Clare, my grandmother, Daisy Farrell."<br><br>"A pleasure, Mrs. Farrell," Clare said.<br><br>"Same here," the older woman said politely. "You're not from town, are you?"<br><br>Clare shook her head. "My parents moved to Am-herst after my sister and I went to college, but we grew up outside Boston. I lived in Boston until I relocated to Knights Bridge in November. My son's in first grade." She smiled. "We're both adjusting."<br><br>"Then you're married?" Daisy Farrell asked. "What's your husband do?"<br><br>"I'm widowed, Mrs. Farrell."<br><br>Clare noticed Logan's sharp look, as if he hadn't considered such a thing.<br><br>"Oh, dear," Daisy said, shaking her head. "You're so young. A fresh start here will be good for you. Knights Bridge is a wonderful town&#x2014;not that I've known any other. Well, until now. I lived in the same house all my life. I was born in an upstairs bedroom."<br><br>Logan touched her elbow. "Here, have a seat, Gran. We'll get your sampler hung. It'll help this place feel more like home."<br><br>"It will, but I'm not feeling sorry for myself. You and your father didn't drag me kicking and spitting into seeing I had to move. I knew it had to be done." She sank into a chair upholstered in a cheerful fabric. "Grace Webster says she'll let me borrow her binoculars until I get a pair, so I can watch the birds, and Audrey Frost wants to sign me up for yoga. What do you think of that, Logan? Audrey's younger than I am. Can I handle yoga?"<br><br>"I'll check with your internist, but I don't see why not, if it's designed for seniors."<br><br>"Well, I won't be doing headstands, I can tell you that."<br><br>"I just got you off a chair, Gran."<br><br>She waved a hand. "Life is full of perils."<br><br>Logan rolled his eyes, good-natured with his grandmother. "That's not an excuse for being reckless."<br><br>"Reckless." Daisy snorted and turned to Clare. "I fell doing the dishes. I've done the dishes every day for the past eighty years. Fortunately I didn't break anything when I fell. All's well that ends well." She leaned forward. "You can tell that to Dr. Farrell."<br><br>Dr. Farrell? Clare glanced at him and decided she wasn't surprised that he was a doctor.<br><br>"Dr. Farrell is glad you didn't break your hip," he said.<br><br>"I am, too. I'd have hated to have one of the Sloan brothers find me half-dead on the kitchen floor. I had them in to fix a leak in the cellar before winter set in."</p><h2>A Play of Heresy (A Joliffe Mystery)</h2><p><i>From the pages of the national bestselling Dame Frevisse mysteries...</i><br><br><b>A FESTIVAL OF MURDER...</b><br><br>In the early summer of 1438, Joliffe and his fellow players have arrived in Coventry for the theatrical festival of Corpus Christi Day. Employed by one of the city's rich and powerful merchant guilds, they plan to present two of the many plays which will extravagantly depict all of God's Story in a parade of pomp and pageantry.<br><br>But even as they prepare to perform the Nativity, Joliffe may be called on to play a wise man off the stage as well. When the merchant Master Kydwa goes missing and is presumed dead, the cunning Bishop Beaufort calls on Joliffe's skills as a spy to uncover the mysteries of Coventry's elite. As suspicion falls on his own companions, Joliffe is drawn into the devilish machinations of a secret sect of heretics bent on destroying the Church.

David Reynolds reveals how these authors broadly assimilated the themes and images of popular culture. Their classic works--among them <i>Moby Dick</i>, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, <i>Walden</i>, and the tales of Poe--are given strikingly original reading when viewed against the rich, often startling background of long neglected popular writings of the time. </p><p> Reynolds also explores a whole lost world of sensational literature, including grisly novels, openly sold on the street, that combined intense violence with explicit eroticism. He demonstrates as well how common concerns with issues of religion, slavery, and workers' (as well as women's) rights resonate in the major writings. </p></p><p><b>David S. Reynolds</b> is Professor of English at the Graduate School and Baruch College, City University of New York.Using the products of popular culture between 1820 and 1855 more comprehensively than do other Renaissance scholars, Reynolds tries to fix our "classic" texts (e.g., Moby Dick ) as culminating transfigurations of, rather than anomalous reactions against, the voluminous literature of their day. He focuses especially on the various reform literatures, new religious evangelical style, and flood of popular fiction, arguing that our major writers were able to absorb the style, themes, and genres of these sub-literary materials without sacrificing aesthetic control. Though he tends to overstate specific influences and embraces too mechanical a model for the creative process, his argument and impressive display of materials make for a significant contribution to American studies.

Two Edgar Awards, and other prizes, only complement the abundant praise that Thomas has received. </p><p>Thomas died in 1995, and since then all but one of his twenty-five novels had gone out of print. This should never have happened to the man of whom <i>The New Yorker</i> has said "Very few...are as consistently entertaining...even fewer can match him for style and power." Minotaur is proud to remedy this situation by reissuing Thomas's novels. So start reading, and prepare to join Ross Thomas's legions of admiring fans.</p>A tiny, godforsaken California town named Durango is the setting for Thomas's ( Out on the Rim ) tense new novel, a suspense story laced with wry wit. The town's mayor, plucky Barbara Huckins, and its chief of police, Sid Fork, are part-time lovers and ex-San Francisco hippies who drifted into Durango 20 years back. The action begins when Jack Adair, an acid-tongued judge falsely accused of taking a big bribe, drops into Durango to hide from whoever wants him silenced. Poor Adair already has a daughter in a mental hospital, a disbarred attorney for a son-in-law and a gay son who committed suicide (or was it murder?). Barbara and Sid, an unlikely duo assisted by no less than four detectives, follow a trail warm with corpses to a brutal killer who dresses up as a priest or a plumber. The socko climax takes place on the Fourth of July, with readers kept in the dark right through the fireworks. In this offbeat diversion, Thomas builds suspense and character almost casually, once again proving himself a master of the crime thriller.

Central to its overall theme is an investigation of the myriad ways both individual and collective violence affect one's capacity to remember, to act, and to love; how violence can challenge theological understandings of grace; and even how the traumatic experience of Jesus' death is remembered. Of particular interest is Jones's focus on the long-term effects of collective violence on abuse survivors, war veterans, and marginalized populations, and the discrete ways in which grace and redemption might be exhibited in each context. At the heart of each essay are two deeply interrelated faith-claims that are central to Jones's understanding of Christian theology: first, we live in a world profoundly broken by violence; second, God loves this world and desires that suffering be met by words of hope, of love, and of grace. This truly cutting-edge book is the first trauma study to directly take into account theological issues.</p></p><p><b>Serene Jones</b> is President of Union Theological Seminary in New York.

In <i>Practice to Deceive</i>, her first book-length investigative chronicle since <i>In the Still of the Night</i>, Rule unravels a shattering case of Christmastime murder off the coast of Washington State&#x2014;presented with the clarity, authority, and emotional depth that Rule&#x2019;s readers expect. It&#x2019;s a case with enough drama, greed, sex, and scandal to be called &#x201c;The Real Housewives of Whidbey Island,&#x201d; but this was not reality television. This was murder: pure, cruel, ugly, and senseless. And someone had to pay the price. <br><br>Nestled in Puget Sound, Whidbey Island is a gem of the Pacific Northwest; accessible only by ferry and the soaring Deception Pass Bridge, it is known for its artistic communities and stunning natural beauty. Life there is low-key, insular, and the island&#x2019;s year-round residents tend to know one another&#x2019;s business. But when the blood-drenched body of Russel Douglas was discovered the day after Christmas in his SUV in a hidden driveway near Whidbey&#x2019;s most exclusive mansions, the whole island was shocked. A single bullet between his eyes was the cause of death, but no one could imagine who among them could plot such a devious, cold-blooded crime. At first, police suspected suicide, tragically common at the height of the holiday season. But when they found no gun in or near the SUV, Russel&#x2019;s manner of death became <i>homicide</i>. Like a cast of characters from a classic mystery novel, a host of Whidbey residents fell under suspicion. <br><br>Brenna Douglas was Russel&#x2019;s estranged and soon-to-be-ex wife, who allowed him to come home for a Christmas visit with their children. The couple owned the popular Just B&#x2019;s salon. Brenna&#x2019;s good friend Peggy Sue Thomas worked there, and Brenna complained often to her that Russel was physically and emotionally abusive. Peggy Sue&#x2019;s own life has been one of extremes. Married three times, hers is a rags-to-riches-and-back-again tale in which she&#x2019;s played many roles: aircraft mechanic, basketball coach, the &#x201c;drop-dead gorgeous&#x201d; beauty queen as a former Ms. Washington, Las Vegas limousine driver, million-dollar horse breeder, wealthy divorc�e. But in 2003, her love affair with married guitarist Jim Huden led the two Whidbey Island natives to pursue their ultimate dreams of wealth and privilege&#x2014;even at the expense of human life. <br><br>Unravel the tangled web woven by Russel Douglas&#x2019;s murder in <i>Practice to Deceive</i>, the newest heart pounding true-crime tour de force from Ann Rule.</p><p>Ann Rule wrote thirty-five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, all of them still in print. Her first bestseller was&nbsp;<i>The Stranger Beside Me</i>, about her personal relationship with infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. A former Seattle police officer, she used her firsthand expertise in all her books. For more than three decades, she was a powerful advocate for victims of violent crime. She lived near Seattle and died in 2015.This is Rule&#x2019;s twenty-fourth true-crime book in a successful sweep that started with her brilliant take on serial killer Ted Bundy, the man she worked next to at a Seattle crisis center. Rule&#x2019;s true-crime books are notable for their in-depth forensics, perceptive trial coverage (often), and keen psychological insight (always). Her latest extends an analogy she has often used: how an investigation into homicide takes, basically, a stick drawing of a person, the victim, and with each piece of evidence and parts of interviews, transforms the stick figure into a rounded, complex human being whose life holds the key to his or her death. In 2003, a man&#x2019;s body was discovered in a car parked in front of a cabin on Whidbey Island, Washington. The victim, Russel Douglas, had a single gunshot wound to his head. The investigation took years to complete (it took a decade to come to trial) and wound through seven states and Mexico. Rule is at her best in tracing Douglas&#x2019; frantic, depression-fueled changes in the years preceding his murder. This time Rule occasionally becomes tedious in her detailed coverage of every phase of the investigation and trial, using her remarkable access to sources to deliver, finally, too much information. Still, this account delivers quite a punch in its final revelations. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>African Americans in Art: Selections from the Art Institute of Chicago</h2><p>Highlights African American artists represented at The Art Institute of Chicago.

She was also a student of classical and modern languages. She is best known for her mysteries, a series of novels and short stories set between World War I and World War II that feature English aristocrat and amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey. However, Sayers herself considered her translation of Dante's Divina Commedia to be her best work. She is also known for her plays and essays. Sayers's most notable religious book is probably The Mind of the Maker which explores at length the analogy between a human Creator (especially a writer of novels and plays) and the doctrine of The Trinity in creation. She suggests that any human creation of significance involves the Idea, the Energy (roughly: the process of writing and that actual 'incarnation' as a material object) and the Power and that this "trinity" has useful analogies with the theological Trinity of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. In addition to the ingenious thinking in working out this analogy, the book contains striking examples drawn from her own experiences as a writer and elegant criticisms of writers when the balance between Idea, Energy and Power is not, in her view, adequate. She defends strongly the view that literary creatures have a nature of their own, vehemently replying to a well-wisher who wanted Lord Peter to "end up a convinced Christian". "From what I know of him, nothing is more unlikely... Peter is not the Ideal Man". Her very influential essay The Lost Tools of Learning has been used by many schools in the US as a basis for the classical education movement, reviving the medieval trivium subjects (grammar, logic and rhetoric) as tools to enable the analysis and mastery of every other subject. Sayers also wrote three volumes of commentaries about Dante, religious essays, and several plays, of which The Man Born to be King may be the best known. Her religious works did so well at presenting the orthodox Anglican position that, in 1943, the Archbishop of Canterbury offered her a Lambeth doctorate in divinity, which she declined. In 1950, however, she accepted an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Durham. Although she never describes herself as such, her economic and political ideas, rooted as they are in the classical Christian doctrines of Creation and Incarnation, are very close to the Chesterton-Belloc theory of Distributism.This delightful production is a perfect introduction to theworld of Lord Peter Wimsey, one of the world's foremost fictionaldetectives. Listeners, who may be familiar with Carmichael's smoothportrayal of Lord Peter from PBS's "Mystery," will equally enjoy hisadept and vivid characterizations of the other characters, includingBunter, Inspector Parker, and Sir Impy Biggs. Lord Peter returns froma vacation to investigate a murder on his own doorstep: His brother,the Duke of Denver, has been arrested for the murder of his sisterMary's fianc�. The unabridged presentation does justice to amultilayered, complex story line and will give listeners a chance tobe reintroduced to one of the earliest appearances of this elegant,classic character.

That she is in a strange place, with no memory of how she got here, will take several seconds to sink in fully. That her life is in danger will hit her all at once, with the sudden force of a giant, renegade wave, knocking her back on the small cot I've so thoughtfully provided, even as she struggles gamely to her feet. </p><p> This is my favorite part. Even more than what comes later. </p><p> I've never been a huge fan of blood and guts. Those shows you see on TV today, the ones that are so popular, the ones filled with crack forensic experts in skintight pants and push-up bras, they've never held much appeal for me. All those dead bodies -- hapless victims dispatched in an increasingly gory variety of exotic ways -- lying on cold steel slabs in ultramodern morgues, waiting to be cracked open and invaded by dispassionate, gloved fingers -- they just don't do it for me. Even if the bodies weren't so obviously fake -- although even the most obvious of rubber torsos look more real than the ubiquitous breast implants held in check by those heroic, push-up bras -- it wouldn't turn me on. Violence, per se, has never been my thing. I've always preferred the buildup to an event over the actual event itself. </p><p> Just as I've always preferred the flawed, natural contour of real breasts to the perfectly inflated -- and perfectly awful -- monstrosities so popular today. And not just on TV. You see them everywhere. Even here in the middle of Alligator Alley, in the middle of south-central Florida. </p><p> The middle of nowhere. </p><p> I think it was Alfred Hitchcock who best summed up the difference between shock and suspense. Shock, he said, is quick, a jolt to the senses that lasts but a second, whereas suspense is more of a slow tease. Rather like the difference between prolonged foreplay and premature ejaculation, I would add, and I like to think old Alfred would chuckle and agree. He always preferred suspense to shock, the payoff being greater, ultimately more fulfilling. I'm with him on this, although, like Hitch, I'm not adverse to the occasional shock along the way. You have to keep things interesting. </p><p> As this girl will soon find out. </p><p> She's sitting up now, hands forming anxious fists at her sides as she scans her dimly lit surroundings. I can tell by the puzzled look on her pretty face -- she's a real heartstopper, as my grandfather used to say -- that she's trying to stay calm, to figure things out, to make sense of what's happening, while clinging to the hope this is all a dream. After all, this can't really be happening. She can't actually be sitting on the edge of a tiny cot in what appears to be a room in somebody's basement, if houses in Florida had basements, which, of course, most of them don't, Florida being a state built almost entirely on swampland. </p><p> The panic won't be long in coming. As soon as she realizes she isn't dreaming, that her situation is real and, in fact, quite dire, that she is trapped in a locked room whose only light comes from a strategically placed lamplight on a ledge high above her head, one she has no way of reaching, even were she to turn the cot on its end and somehow manage to climb up its side. The last girl tried that and fell, crying and clutching her broken wrist, to the dirt floor. That's when she started screaming. </p><p> That was fun -- for a while. </p><p> She's just noticed the door, although unlike the last girl, she makes no move toward it. Instead, she just sits there, chewing on her bottom lip, frightened eyes darting back and forth. She's breathing loudly and visibly, her heart threatening to burst from between large, pendulous breasts -- to her credit, at least they're real -- like one of those hyperventilating contestants on The Price Is Right. Should she choose door number one, door number two, or door number three? Except there is only one door, and should she open it, what will she find? The Lady or the Tiger? Safety or destruction? I feel my lips curl into a smile. In fact, she will find nothing. At least not yet. Not until I'm ready. </p><p> She's pushing herself off the cot, curiosity finally forcing one foot in front of the other, propelling her toward the door, even as a gnawing voice whispers in her ear, reminding her it was curiosity that killed the cat. Is she counting on the old wives' tale about cats having nine lives? Does she think a bunch of useless, old wives can save her? </p><p> Her trembling hand stretches toward the doorknob. "Hello?" she calls out, softly at first, her voice as wobbly as her fingers, then more forcefully. "Hello? Is anybody there?" </p><p> I'm tempted to answer, but I know this isn't a good idea. First of all, it would tip her to the fact I'm watching. Right now, the idea she's being observed has yet to occur to her, and when it does, maybe a minute or two from now, her eyes will begin their frantic, fruitless search of the premises. No matter. She won't be able to see me. The peephole I've carved into the wall is too small and too elevated for her to discover, especially in this meager light. Besides, hearing my voice would not only tip her to my presence and approximate location, it might help her identify me, thereby giving her an unnecessary edge in the battle of wits to come. No, I will present myself soon enough. No point in getting ahead of the game. The timing simply isn't right. And timing, as they say, is everything. </p><p> "Hello? Somebody?" </p><p> Her voice is growing more urgent, losing its girlish timbre, becoming shrill, almost hostile. That's one of the interesting things I've noticed about female voices -- how quickly they jump from warm to harsh, from soothing to grating, how shameless they are in their eagerness to reveal all, how boldly they hurl their insecurities into the unsuspecting air. The gentle flute is overwhelmed by the raucous bagpipe; the chamber orchestra is trampled by the marching band. </p><p> "Hello?" The girl grabs hold of the doorknob, tries pulling the door toward her. It doesn't budge. Quickly, her movements degenerate into a series of ungainly poses, becoming less measured, more frantic. She pulls on the door, then pushes it, then bangs her shoulder against it, repeating the process several more times before finally giving up and bursting into tears. That's the other thing I've learned about women -- they always cry. It's the one thing about them that never disappoints, the one thing you can count on. </p><p> "Where am I? What's going on here?" The girl bangs her fists against the door in growing frustration. She's angry now, as well as scared. She may not know where she is, but she knows she didn't get here by her own accord. Her mind is rapidly filling with increasingly terrifying images -- recent newspaper headlines about missing girls, TV coverage of bodies being pulled from shallow graves, catalog displays of knives and other instruments of torture, film clips of helpless women being raped and strangled, before being dumped into slime-covered swamps. "Help!" she starts screaming. "Somebody help me." But even as her plaintive cries hit the stale air, I suspect she knows such pleas are useless, that nobody can hear her. </p><p> Nobody but me. </p><p> Her head snaps up; her eyes shoot toward me, like a searchlight, and I jerk away from the wall, almost tripping over my feet as I stagger back. By the time I regroup, regain my breath and equilibrium, she is circling the small room, her eyes darting up and down, this way and that, the palms of her hands pushing against the unpainted, concrete walls, feeling for any signs of weakness. "Where am I? Is anybody out there? Why have you brought me here?" she is crying, as if the correct question will trigger a reassuring response. Finally, she gives up, collapses on the cot, cries some more. When she raises her head again -- for the second time, she looks right at me -- her large blue eyes are bloated with tears and ringed in unflattering red. Or maybe that's just my imagination at work. A bit of wishful thinking on my part. </p><p> She pushes herself back into a sitting position, takes a series of long, deep breaths. Clearly, she is trying to calm herself, while she takes stock of her situation. She glances at what she's wearing -- a pale yellow T-shirt that shouts, MOVE, BITCH, in bright lime-green lettering across its stretched front, low-slung jeans pulled tight across her slender hips. The same outfit she was wearing...when? Yesterday? Last night? This morning? </p><p> How long has she been here? </p><p> She runs her fingers through long, strawberry-blond hair, then scratches at her right ankle, before leaning back against the wall. Some madman has kidnapped her and is holding her hostage, she is thinking, perhaps already wondering how she can tell this story to maximum effect after she escapes. Perhaps People magazine will come calling. Maybe even Hollywood. Who will they get to play her? The girl from Spider-Man, or maybe that other one, the one who's all over the tabloids these days. Lindsay Lohan? Is that her name? Or is it Tara Reid? Cameron Diaz would be good, even though Cameron's more than a decade older than she is. It doesn't really matter. They're all more or less interchangeable. Heartstoppers all. </p><p> As am I. A heartstopper of a very different kind. </p><p> The girl's face darkens. Once again, reality intrudes. What am I doing here? she is wondering. How did I get here? Why can't I remember? </p><p> What she probably remembers is being in school, although I doubt she recalls much, if anything, of what was being taught. Too busy staring out the window. Too busy flirting with the Neanderthals in the back row. Too busy giving the teacher a hard time. Too ready with the smart remark, the sarcastic comment, the unasked-for opinion. No doubt she recalls the bell sounding at the end of the day, releasing her from her twelfth-grade prison. She likely remembers rushing into the school yard, and bum...</p></p><h2>The Christmas Cat</h2><p>A cozy Nativity story for those who love Christmas and cats.<br><br>All babies are beautiful and all babies cry. Jesus was no exception. On the night he was born, nothing Mary, Joseph, or the animals in the stable could do would comfort him. But when a curious kitten wanted its turn to calm the baby Jesus, a loving friendship blossomed on that very first Christmas.<br><br>This perfect read-aloud was inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's drawings of <i>La Madonna del Gatto</i>, which show Mary lovingly holding the baby Jesus who is cuddling a cat.</p><p>Maryann Macdonald grew up near Detroit with seven brothers and sisters.&nbsp; She lived for many years in Europe, but has now settled in New York City.&nbsp; &nbsp;One day, while exploring the Metropolitan Museum there, she discovered the Leonardo da Vinci drawing that inspired her to write <i>The Christmas Cat</i>.&nbsp; She has written numerous books for children.<br><br>Amy June Bates grew up in Utah and graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in illustration. She has illustrated over forty books for children and has been honored by the Society of Illustrators for her work. She lives in Pennsylvania with her husband and children.K-Gr 3-According to the author's note, this somewhat lengthy story was inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's drawings of La Madonna del Gatto as well as legends of a cat that purred Jesus to sleep. Only a kitten hiding in the stables can console a crying baby Jesus, and the two newborns form a bond. Later, when the family must flee Herod's forces, the feline can't be found and is seemingly left behind. Much to the delight of a heartbroken Jesus, the cat has secretly stowed away in the family's belongings, helping to keep him quiet as they escape to Egypt. With its focus beyond the Nativity, this story is an interesting change from typical Christmas fare. The expressive characters set against the rich background of watercolors in ochres, blues, and grays are lovely, but the frequent use of white text against this background makes reading a challenge. Cat lovers might be the best audience for this take on a familiar tale.-Brooke Sheets, Los Angeles Public Library&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

In this last of the Tub People trilogy, the beloved tub toys meet Santa, who rescues the Tub Child from the overly friendly family dog. After a thrill ride in the big bearded fellow's pocket, the Tub People are all placed gently on the Christmas tree where, wonder of wonders, the Tub Child, in the place of honor at the very top, gets to look down on his entire laughing family mixed merrily in with popcorn and candy canes and stars.</p><p> Author Pam Conrad is pictured at the beginning and end of the book as an angel, the Tub People's creator and guardian. All the Tub People become angels on the end papers and are reproduced in a sheet of beautiful Tub People Christmas ornaments that children can hang on their tree.</p></p><p><p>Pam Conrad wrote many award-winning books for children, including the immensely popular <em>The Tub People </em> and <em> The Tub Grandfather,</em> both illustrated by Richard Egielski. She is also the author of a number of critically acclaimed novels, including Prairie Songs, a 1986 ALA Best Children's Book of the Year and a 1985 ALA Golden Kite Honor Book, and <em> Stonewords, </em> winner of the 1991 Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Juvenile Mystery.</p><br><br><p>Richard Egielski is the Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator of <em>Hey, Al</em> and many other books for children, including the Tub People series by Pam Conrad. He is also the author and illustrator of <em>Buz</em> and <em>Jazper</em>, both <em>New York Times</em> Best Illustrated Books, <em>Three Magic Balls</em>, and <em>The Gingerbread Boy</em>. Mr. Egielski lives in Milford, New Jersey, with his wife and son.</p>PreSchool-Grade 3-This story reaches for but doesn't quite evoke that special moving quality of the most memorable Christmas books. Standing guard before the fireplace (they don't know precisely why), the Tub People are knocked to the floor when a "large man" comes down the chimney. He retrieves them, and for a time they wait in his pocket; then, one by one, they are lifted out and hung on the Christmas tree, like ornaments. The Tub Grandfather had "pressed a silver hook into the Tub Child's hand" early in the story and it earns the child a place at the top of the tree. As in the earlier titles about the Tub People, Egielski's brilliant illustrations enable readers to enter the world of the round wooden dolls. However, this slight story is not as involving or as dramatic as those books, and literal-minded children will wonder just how those silver hooks are "grasped" by the fingerless figures.-S.P. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>New Quilting and Patchwork Dictionary</h2><p>At last, here is the long-awaited illustrated New Quilting &amp; Patchwork Dictionary, which offers more than 1,740 photographs and diagrams of the most known and unknown patterns of the last two centuries.

Burns is the sort of meticulous, uncompromising artist whom other artists speak of with envy and reverence, and we asked Ware and Clowes to comment on their admiration for <i>Black Hole</i>:<p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"I think I probably learned the most about clarity, composition, and efficiency from looking at Charles's pages spread out on my drawing table than from anyone's; his was always at the level of lucidity of <i>Nancy</i>, but with this odd, metallic tinge to it that left you feeling very unsettled, especially if you were an aspiring cartoonist, because it was clear you'd never be half as good as he was. There's an almost metaphysical intensity to his pinprick-like inkline that catches you somewhere in the back of the throat, a paper-thin blade of a fine jeweler's saw tracing the outline of these thick, clay-like human figures that somehow seem to "move," but are also inevitably oddly frozen in eternal, awkward poses ... it's an unlikely combination of feelings, and it all adds up to something unmistakably his own.<p> "I must have been one of the first customers to arrive at the comic shop when I heard the first issue of <i>Black Hole</i> was out 10 years ago, and my excitement didn't change over the years as he completed it. I don't think I've ever read anything that better captures the details, feelings, anxieties, smells, and cringing horror of my own teenage years better than <i>Black Hole</i>, and I'm 15 years younger than Charles is. <i>Black Hole</i> is so redolently affecting one almost has to put the book down for air every once in a while. By the book's end, one ends up feeling so deeply for the main character it's all one can do not to turn the book over and start reading again." --<i>Chris Ware</i> </p></td> </tr><tr> </tr><tr> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"Charles Burns is one of the greats of modern comics. His comics are beautiful on so many levels. Somehow he has managed to capture the essential electricity of comic-book pop-art iconography, dragging it from the clutches of Fine Art back to the service of his perfect, precise-but-elusive narratives in a way that is both universal in its instant appeal and deeply personal." --<i>Dan Clowes</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong>Questions for Charles Burns</strong></p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Cartoonists are about the only people today who are working like Dickens did: writing serials that appear piece-by-piece in public before the whole work is done. What's it like to work in public like that, and for as long as a project like this takes?<br> <strong>Charles Burns:</strong> There were a number of reasons for serializing <i>Black Hole</i>. First of all, I wanted to put out a traditional comic book-- I'd never really worked in that comic pamphlet format before and liked the idea of developing a long story in installments. There's something very satisfying to me about a comic book as an object and I enjoyed using that format to slowly build my story. Serializing the story also allowed me to focus on shorter, more manageable portions; if I had to face creating a 368-page book all in one big lump, I don't know if I&#x2019;d have the perseverance and energy to pull it off.<br> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> One thing that stuns me about this book is how consistent it is from start to finish. From the first frames to the last ones that you drew 10 years later, you held the same tone and style. It feels as though you had a complete vision for the book from the very beginning. Is that so? Or did things develop unexpectedly as you worked on it?<br> <strong>Burns:</strong> I guess there's a consistency in <i>Black Hole</i> because of the way I work. I write and draw very slowly, always carefully examining every little detail to make sure it all fits together the way I want it to. When I started the story, I had it all charted out as far as the basic structure goes, but what made working on it interesting was finding new ways of telling the story that hadn't occurred to me.<br> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Some of the very best of the recent graphic novels (I'm thinking of <i>Ghost World</i> and <i>Blankets</i>, along with <i>Black Hole</i>) have been about the lives of teenagers. Do you think there's something about the form that helps to tell those stories so well?<br> <strong>Burns:</strong> That's an interesting question, but I don't know the answer. Perhaps it has more to do with the authors--the kind of people who stay indoors for hours on end in total solitude working away on their heartfelt stories... maybe that kind of reflection lends itself to being able to capture the intensity of adolescence.<br> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> In the time you've been working on <i>Black Hole</i>, graphic novels have leapt into the mainstream. (I think--I hope--we're finally seeing the last of those "They're not just for kids anymore!" reviews.) What did you imagine for this project when you started it? What's it been like to see your corner of the world enter the glare of the spotlight?<br> <strong>Burns:</strong> When I started <i>Black Hole</i> I really just wanted to tell a long, well-written story. The themes and ideas that run throughout the book had been turning around in my head for years and I wanted to finally get them all out--put them down on paper once and for all. I've published a few other books and while they sold reasonably well, they didn't set the publishing world on fire. I was pretty sure I'd have some kind of an audience for <i>Black Hole</i>, but that was never a motivating factor in writing the book. And my corner of the world is still pretty dark. I guess I'll be stepping into the spotlight for a little while when the book comes out, but I imagine I'll slip back into my dark little studio when it all settles down again so I can settle back into work. </p><p></p>Charles Burns grew up in Seattle in the 1970s. His work rose to prominence in Art Spiegelman&#39;s Raw magazine in the mid-1980s and took off from there, for an extraordinary range of comics and projects, from Iggy Pop album covers to the latest ad campaign for Altoids.

The first complete manuscript ever found from the legendary military strategist Sun Tzu II (commonly known as Sun Bin, a lineal descendent of the great Sun Tzu), this sophisticated manual delves even deeper than The Art of War into the complex principles and practices of organizations, tactical formation, strategic maneuvering, and adaptation. Like those of his distinguished ancestor, Sun Tzu II's insights and strategies can be applied to life situations far beyond warfare - including government, diplomacy, business, relationship, and social action.<br>Renowned scholar Thomas Cleary, universally praised for his ability to capture the often cryptic meanings of Chinese texts, has masterfully translated the subtle and challenging original text of The Lost Art of War and has contemporized Sun Tzu II's strategic insights with his own illuminating and accessible commentary.<br>An ancient version of Sun Tzu's The Art of War was also found in the tomb, which differs significantly from previously known editions. Thus, Cleary additionally offers a fascinating analysis comparing the teachings of The Lost Art of War to those of the classic The Art of War as it is presented in this newly discovered version. Sun Tzu II draws on other traditions of strategic thinking while extending the teachings of his ancestor.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>Station Eleven</h2><p>The sudden death of a Hollywood actor during a production of &#34;King Lear&#34; marks the beginning of the world&#39;s dissolution in a story told at various past and future times from the perspectives of the actor and four of his associates.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, September 2014:</strong> A flight from Russia lands in middle America, its passengers carrying a virus that explodes &#x201c;like a neutron bomb over the surface of the earth.&#x201d; In a blink, the world as we know it collapses. &#x201c;No more ballgames played under floodlights,&#x201d; Emily St. John Mandel writes in this smart and sober homage to life&#x2019;s smaller pleasures, brutally erased by an apocalypse. &#x201c;No more trains running under the surface of cities ... No more cities ... No more Internet ... No more avatars.&#x201d; Survivors become scavengers, roaming the ravaged landscape or clustering in pocket settlements, some of them welcoming, some dangerous. What&#x2019;s touching about the world of <i>Station Eleven</i> is its ode to what survived, in particular the music and plays performed for wasteland communities by a roving Shakespeare troupe, the Traveling Symphony, whose members form a wounded family of sorts. The story shifts deftly between the fraught post-apocalyptic world and, twenty years earlier, just before the apocalypse, the death of a famous actor, which has a rippling effect across the decades. It&#x2019;s heartbreaking to watch the troupe strive for more than mere survival.

Borthwick's latest mystery romp involving Sarah Deane--a teaching fellow and doctoral candidate at Bowmouth College in Maine--and her physician husband, Alex McKenzie, is crystallized with this little exchange: <blockquote>"I think," said Julia, standing up and gathering her handbag to her breast, "that we can give Deedee and Richard a miss. Who in God's name wants to hear all the ghastly details about people being chopped up with cutlasses and clinging to rafts?"<p> Alex smiled down at Julia. "You'd rather read Dick Francis describing maimed horses and mutilated jockeys? Or," he added with a side glance at Sarah, who was a fan of Brother Cadfael and his felonious associates in 13th-century Shrewsbury, "entertain yourself with poisoned yeomen and decapitated monks?"</p></blockquote> Sarah and Alex are sailing home from Europe with Sarah's elderly but feisty Aunt Julia, and the supposed subject of their conversation is whether to attend a shipboard lecture on pirates. But what Borthwick is really doing is placing her readers in familiar territory--that comfortable country where Dick Francis and Ellis Peters meet Agatha Christie for tea.<p> In this country, anyone who gets on board a brand new ocean liner (in this case, the <i>Queen Victoria</i>) knows that the shipboard activities will include murder, as well as shuffleboard, and that Sarah and Alex will clear things up long before the ship docks in New York. One reader's d�j� vu is another's homage, and Borthwick writes with verve and grace--as witnessed by the popularity of past titles such as <i>The Bridled Groom</i>, <i>The Case of the Hook-Billed Kites</i>, <i>Dolly Is Dead</i>, <i>The Down East Murders</i>, <i>Dude on Arrival</i>, <i>The Garden Plot</i>, and <i>The Student Body</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>With her signature blend of wit, whimsy, and intrigue, acclaimed author J. S. Borthwick presents her ninth delightful Sarah Deane mystery-- a clever, crackling novel that once again proves to be "more fun than a barrel of clams at high tide."<br><br>J. S. Borthwick lives with her family on the Maine coast, where many of her mysteries are set.<br></p><h2>The Body Never Lies: The Lingering Effects of Cruel Parenting</h2><p><p><strong>In this empowering work, writes Rutgers professor Philip Greven, "readers will learn how to confront the overt and covert traumas of their own childhoods with the enlightened guidance of Alice Miller.</strong></p> Never before has world-renowned psychoanalyst Alice Miller examined so persuasively the long-range consequences of childhood abuse on the body. Using the experiences of her patients along with the biographical stories of literary giants such as Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka, and Marcel Proust, Miller shows how a child's humiliation, impotence, and bottled rage will manifest itself as adult illness; be it cancer, stroke, or other debilitating diseases. Never one to shy away from controversy, Miller urges society as a whole to jettison its belief in the Fourth Commandment and not to extend forgiveness to parents whose tyrannical childrearing methods have resulted in unhappy, and often ruined, adult lives.</p><p>Alice Miller&nbsp;(1923-2010) is the author of such classic works as The Drama of the Gifted Child, Prisoners of Childhood, The Body Never Lies, From Rage to Courage, and Free from Lies.In her latest vehement treatise, Swiss psychoanalyst Miller (<i>The Drama of the Gifted Child</i>) reprises her classic critiques of filial duty. In her view, our culture systematically denies childhood abuse sufferers access to their true feelings. Repressed emotional responses to early humiliations and unfulfilled needs are inevitably transferred to the body, Miller believes, producing long-term illness. She also believes that the majority of therapists are bent on fostering an attitude of forgiveness. Miller instead urges the reader to reappraise the substance of the Fourth Commandment, which she construes as containing "a kind of moral blackmail" and, reflecting on her own unhappy childhood, argues that what survivors of parental cruelty need most is someone who shares their feelings of indignation. Miller traces the relationship between inadequate or tyrannical parenting and adult bodily illness, depression and suicide in pithy biographies of Dostoyevski, Chekhov, Kafka, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce and many others. Yet Miller is more a subjective observer and a guru than a social scientist. Her highly personal, undertheorized and generalizing approach will strike some as simplistic, yet those who loyally follow her child-centered philosophy will probably find much to enjoy in the conviction with which she writes. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now that the "off-islanders" are finally off the island, ex-Boston cop J.W. Jackson is free to relax, fish, and make future plans with his lady love Zee. But the natives are getting seriously restless this fall, with animal rights activists squaring off against deer slayers and environmentalists butting heads with land developers. Things have reached the boiling-over point -- and it's not long before verbal arrows become real ones. And when a most unlikely victim is caught in the lethal crossfire, Jackson can't just sit by idly with a fishing pole in his hand. Someone has to lead the hunt for a killer, and J.W.'s the man -- even if there's a chance that he won't live to see next summer.</p></p><p><p>Philip R. Craig grew up on a small cattle ranch near Durango, Colorado, before going off to college at Boston University, where he was an All-American fencer. He earned his M.F.A. at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. A recently retired professor of English at Wheelock College in Boston, he and his wife Shirley now live year-round on Martha's Vineyard.</p>As fisherman/sleuth J. W. Jackson gets increasingly adept in the kitchen, this Martha's Vineyard series brings Martha Stewart to mind, but the fun remains as Jackson proves he can still finger a murderer as deftly as he opens oysters. At issue here is 50 acres of land, coveted by hunters and animal-rights activists. Although the loud-mouthed leaders of both groups seem destined for homicide, the man who dies is an eccentric recluse with few enemies, a surprising way with the ladies, some strange sexual aids in his cabin and a bow and arrow, which is the weapon that kills him. The victim's link to the land squabble is his friendship with the daughter of an animal-rights supporter whose husband has political aspirations. Meanwhile, the hunters' spokesman is attacked by a thug linked to organized crime. Jackson has his hands full: hunting down scallops, cooking up batches of kale soup and staying on an even keel with Zee, the girl of his dreams and soon-to-be wife, if their attacks of nerves don't skuttle the pending nuptials. He also has to find the killer, which he does quite handily. Although Jackson verges on smug, the beauty of Craig's ( The Woman Who Walked into the Sea ) New England settings seem to justify his hero's pride in his soup, his boat, his girlfriend and his own, considerable charm. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Musubi Man: Hawaii&#39;s Gingerbread Man</h2><p>A freshly baked musubi man escapes from the old woman&#39;s kitchen and eludes his pursuers in this Hawaiian version of the Gingerbread boy.</p><p></p><h2>Marisol (American Girl Today)</h2><p>Marisol Luna is a lively 10-year-old girl who was born to dance.

At first mistrustful of Lamb, one another, and the writing process, over time these students let down their guard, picked up their pens, and discovered their voices. In this unforgettable collection, the women of York describe in their own words how they were imprisoned by abuse, rejection, and their own self-destructive impulses long before they entered the criminal justice system. Yet these are stories of hope, humor, and triumph in the face of despair. Having used writing as a tool to unlock their creativity and begin the process of healing, these amazing writers have left victimhood behind.</p><p>In his powerful introduction, Lamb describes the incredible journey of expression and self-awareness the women took through their writings and shares how they challenged him as a teacher and as a fellow author. In "Hair Chronicles," Tabatha Rowley tells her life history through her past hairstyles -- outer signals to the world each time she reinvented herself and eventually came to prize her own self-worth. Brenda Medina admits in "Hell, and How I got Here" that she continued to rebel in prison until her parents' abiding love made her realize that her misbehavior was hurting them and herself deeply. In "Faith, Power, and Pants," Bonnie Foreshaw describes how faith has carried her through trials in life and in prison and has allowed her to understand her past actions, to look toward the future, and to believe that she will once again taste home cooking. <em>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</em> is a true testament to the process of finding oneself and working toward a better day.</p></p><p>Any book that can give voice to the voiceless should be celebrated. No one feels this more strongly than Wally Lamb, editor of <i>Couldn't Keep It to Myself</i>, a collection of stories by 11 women imprisoned in the York Correctional Institution in Connecticut. Teacher and novelist Lamb was invited to head a writing workshop at York Correctional Institution in 1999. His somewhat reluctant acceptance soon turned into steadfast advocacy once the women in his charge began to tell their stories. Lamb maintains that there are things we need to know about prison and prisoners: "There are misconceptions to be abandoned, biases to be dropped." However, as heartfelt as his appeal is, nothing speaks more convincingly in this book than the stories themselves.<p>Those collected here are disturbing and horrific. They reveal, often in graphic detail, the worst kind of abuse: incest, drug addiction, spousal violence, parental neglect, or incompetence. They're also testimony to what social workers and health care professionals have confirmed for years--that those who populate our prisons are often victims first themselves. Thus, the telling of these stories serves as a form of therapy. They are also sad accounts of the brutalities many suffer, yet few discuss: "One day I figured out a dying little girl lived inside of me, so I threw her a lifeline in the form of paper and pen." Considering the degradation the contributors have experienced both in and outside prison, the courage, candor, and honesty with which they speak truly make these stories, as difficult as they are to read, "victories against voicelessness--miracles in print." <i>--Silvana Tropea</i></p><p>Wally Lamb is the author of five <em>New York Times</em> bestselling novels: <em>She&#x2019;s Come Undone</em>, <em>I Know This Much Is True</em>, <em>The Hour I First Believed</em>, <em>Wishin&#x2019; and Hopin&#x2019;</em>, and <em>We Are Water</em>.

Launching the series: <i>The Essential George Booth </i>and <i>The Essential Charles Barsotti</i>. Charles Barsotti is also a 30-year veteran of <i>The New Yorker</i>, and in Barsotti Lorenz presents an overview of this signature cartoonist whose rounded, elegant, sparsely detailed style evokes both the traditional world of a Thurber and the contemporary sensibility of a Roz Chast. With his simple repertory--including a nameless but lovable pooch and a monarch whose kingdom consists of a guard and a telephone--Barsotti manages to miraculously dissipate the clouds in people's minds with his unexpected humor.</p><p>Though Charles Barsotti may seem like the quintessential <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist--droll punch lines underlining clean, spare drawings--his career has in fact been remarkably varied, encompassing everything from just-this-side-of-cutesy doodles for Hallmark to brash one-liners for <i>Playboy</i>. <i>The Essential Charles Barsotti</i> also takes the reader through his stint at <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> and even a failed run at the United States Congress. Barsotti proves himself to be refreshingly versatile, equally adept at turning out surreal, one-panel cartoons and longer, text-based pieces. Particularly good is a quietly subversive parody of civil defense posters that deals with the proper techniques for spotting enemy dirigibles ("A: LOOK UP"). Barsotti himself proves to be as interesting as his cartoons--through interviews interspersed throughout the book, he emerges as a stand-up guy, able to maintain his principles without losing his sense of humor. <i>--Ali Davis</i>Stone-Hearted Tycoons, Wisecracking Pasta, Mischievous Puppies, Kings and Cowboys...<p> By happily disregarding all the ground rules, Charles Barsotti has created his own original world - sophisticated one moment and whimsical the next, sweet and then satirical. Now the artist is getting his due in The Essential Charles Barsotti, a collection of over 100 drawings plus and appreciation and interview by noted cartoonist and art editor Lee Lorenz.</p><p></p></p><h2>Death At The Seaside</h2><p>Death at the Seaside</p><p>Frances Brody is the author of the Kate Shackleton mysteries, as well as many stories and plays for BBC Radio, scripts for television and four sagas, one of which won the HarperCollins Elizabeth Elgin Award.

What secrets does this old ball have to tell? Her mom certainly isn&#39;t sharing anyespecially when it comes to Izzy&#39;s father, who died before Izzy was born. But when she spends the summer in her Nana&#39;s remote New Mexico village, Izzy discovers long-buried secrets that come alive in an enchanted landscape of watermelon mountains, whispering winds, and tortilla suns. Infused with the flavor of the southwest and sprinkled with just a pinch of magic, this heartfelt middle grade debut is as rich and satisfying as Nana&#39;s homemade enchiladas.</p><p>Jennifer Cervantes lives with her husband and three daughters in Las Cruces, New Mexico, where she enjoys sunsets, tortillas, and chiles fresh from the family farm. Tortilla Sun is her first novel for children, and she is currently working on her second.Grade 5&#x2013;7&#x2014;Twelve-year-old Izzy is dismayed to learn that her widowed mother will be finishing her studies in Costa Rica, and that she will spend the summer with her grandmother in New Mexico. Before she leaves, she uncovers a baseball that belonged to her father. It has a mysterious message scrawled across it, "Because...magic," and, like all things relating to her late husband, Izzy's mother won't explain. Nana warmly welcomes her granddaughter to her remote village, a place that seems frozen in time. Izzy meets Nana's friends and neighbors, learns to make tortillas, and watches her grandmother, a <i>curandera</i>, prepare folk remedies. She also begins to uncover the mystery surrounding her father's life and death. Cervantes's prose is lean and lightly spiced with evocative metaphor. Unfortunately, the plot feels all too familiar: the wise grandmother, the loving mother who refuses to speak of the past, and the melodramatic resolution. The characters are gracefully limned yet fail to rise above convention. This gentle family story may hold appeal for those who have enjoyed the works of Pam Mu�oz Ryan and Toby Johnston.&#x2014;<i>Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is particularly noticeable in the value changes for France this year, where a soft market is reflected in numerous decreases among the almost 4,900 value changes. Almost 350 value changes were made among the classic issues of China. Value changes for stamps from 1878 through the early 1900s reflect a strong market, with many increases in values, some substantial. An ongoing Scott project to include listings for complete booklets among the Canada listings continues this year, expanding the listings for complete booklets from 1900-1935. Contains Stamp Information on the following Countries: Cambodia - Cameroon - Canada - Cape Verde - Caribbean Netherlands - Cayman Islands - Central African Republic - Chad - Chile - China - Christmas Island - Cocos Island - Colombia - Comoro Islands - Congo Republic - Cook Islands - Costa Rica - Croatia - Curacao - Cyprus - Czech Republic - Denmark - Djibouti - Dominica - Dominican Republic - Ecuador - Egypt - Equatorial Guinea - Eritrea - Estonia - Ethiopia - Falkland Islands - Faroe Islands - Fiji - Finland - France - French Polynesia - French Southern &amp; Antarctic Territory Updates and Changes for 2018 In Czechoslovakia/Czech Republic, footnotes were added or expanded to include formats and values for recent issues of the Czech Republic that were printed in sheets that also include decorative labels. More than 150 value changes in Cambodia reflect more increases than decreases. The changes are mostly among key issues. Almost 350 value changes were made among the classic issues of China. Value changes for stamps from 1878 through the early 1900s reflect a strong market, with many increases in values, some substantial. The 1897 10-cent-on-12c (Scott 45) soars from $35,000 unused to $50,000, and from $2,750 used to $2,850. The issues of the People s Republic of China continue to show strength, but the stamps no longer are setting record prices. Overall values are slipping, except for values of great rarities. Decreases occur among the Cultural Revolution issues. Among the 147 value changes in Costa Rica, all reflect increases, some more substantial than others. The 1889 5-centimo orange in an imperforate pair (Scott 27a) soars from $250 used to $750. A full line-by-line review of Cook Islands results in more than 1,400 value changes. Many decreases in values reflect a weak New Zealand dollar and a slow market. The increases that occur are among the classic stamps. Mostly increases are found among the value changes for stamps of East Africa and Uganda Protectorates. Many of the changes reflect jumps of 10 percent to 15 percent Editorial changes have been made throughout the catalog. Various notes and footnotes have been clarified or changed to ensure accuracy. The 2018 edition of the Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue celebrates the 150th anniversary of the Scott catalogs. The title pages of this volume and other volumes in the 2018 Scott Standard catalog state that this is the 174th edition of the catalogs (and it is). In September 1868, John Walter Scott published his first stamp catalog. The catalog, titled A Descriptive Catalogue of America and Foreign Postage Stamps, Issued from 1840 to Date, is considered to be the first Scott stamp catalog</p><p></p><h2>Baby&#39;s First Felony (A Cecil Younger Investigation)</h2><p><b>Shamus Award&#x2013;winner John Straley returns to his critically acclaimed Cecil Younger detective series, set in Sitka, Alaska, a land of perfect beauty and not-so-perfect locals.<br><br></b>Criminal defense investigator Cecil Younger spends his days coaching would-be felons on how to avoid incriminating themselves. He even likes most of the rough characters who seek his services. So when Sherrie, a returning client, asks him to track down some evidence to clear her of a domestic violence charge, Cecil agrees. Maybe he&#x2019;ll find something that will get her abusive boyfriend locked up for good.<br><br>Cecil treks out to the shady apartment complex only to discover the &#x201c;evidence&#x201d; is a large pile of cash&#x2014;fifty thousand dollars, to be exact. That is how Cecil finds himself in violation of one of his own maxims: Nothing good comes of walking around with a lot of someone else&#x2019;s money.<br><br>In this case, &#x201c;nothing good&#x201d; turns out to be a deep freeze full of drug-stuffed fish, a murder witnessed at close range, and a kidnapping&#x2014;his teenage daughter, Blossom, is snatched as collateral for his cooperation. The reluctant, deeply unlucky investigator turns to an unlikely source for help: the misfit gang of clients he&#x2019;s helped to defend over the years. Together, they devise a plan to free Blossom and restore order to Sitka. But when your only hope for justice lies in the hands of a group of criminals, things don&#x2019;t always go according to plan.</p><p>John Straley was born in Redwood City, California. He received a BA in English from the University of Washington, but settled in Sitka, Alaska, with his wife, Jan, a prominent whale biologist. John worked for thirty years as a criminal defense investigator, and many of the characters in his books were inspired by his work. Now retired, he lives with his wife in a bright green house on the beach and writes in his weathertight office overlooking Old Sitka Rocks. The former Writer Laureate of Alaska, he is the author of ten novels, including <i>Cold Storage, Alaska</i> and the Shamus Award&#x2013;winner <i>The Woman Who Married a Bear</i>, the first Cecil Younger investigation.If it please the Court: Your Honors, I stand before you today to tell the story of what happened. My words are not to be offered as any form of excuse, not even as an explanation, but I want to tell you the entire experience as it happened to me. Then, of course, you will be free to decide what you will.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the year of a hundred and six consecutive days of rain, and I had lost my daughter to her cell phone. The rain began at the end of summer, but the days were indistinguishable from late fall, each blending one to another in a slurry of rainfall, brightened only by a sunbreak a few minutes each day. The first completely dry day did not occur until December, when we had a cold high-pressure system move in that brought freezing temperatures that turned Swan Lake into a mirror of ice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People&#x2019;s moods in Sitka, Alaska, were irritable both during and after the rain. This story starts in September before the darkest of the dark days had hit. This was still during the period of the jokes and well before the deaths and mayhem.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd had been asking me about the meaning of the Buddhist concept of &#x201c;right relationship.&#x201d; Now, Your Honors, I know you might think I&#x2019;m already beginning to drift, but bear with me, for this turns out to be one of the more slippery of the foundational stones of the eight-fold path&#x2014;not that there are any real bodhisattvas in this cast of characters. But there are, as they say, many ways to get lost in this world, and &#x201c;wrong relationship&#x201d; is one of the most common.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you may remember from the previous briefing, Todd lives in my house and has for many years. He was involved in the circumstances of this crime, a fact that I still regret. He and I are both now in our late fifties, and we relate to each other as brothers, even though there was a time when he was my ward, and I essentially had legal custody of him after his parents passed away. Todd rests comfortably on the solidly affected end of the Asperger&#x2019;s scale. Recently he has been learning to tell jokes as part of his occupational therapy. Joke telling, it turns out, helps create a kind of ready-made emotional relationship for people with autism. They say funny things, people laugh, display emotion and the autistic person laughs in response to the other person&#x2019;s laughter and presto: without having a clue of what an inner emotional world is like, they have entered into an emotional relationship.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd has lived his life with a series of obsessions. He has been fascinated with the patterns on manhole covers and the mechanics of how whales swim across the ocean. He has memorized the populations of all the major cities in the world and knows the make and model of almost every audio recording device ever manufactured. He loves animals and children, and his current interests include Buddhism and telling jokes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd and I were walking back from work. I had walked from the Public Defender Agency, where I worked as a criminal defense investigator. I had stopped off at the jail to see one of our clients who had been locked up, and then I went over to the senior center to pick up Todd from his job in the kitchen. The rain was easing up to a light pebbling on the lake, and a few ducks were waddling in the middle of the street where someone had dumped a full bag of chips out of their car. This was irritating to the drivers along Lake Street but not enough for anyone to blow their horn, because it appeared that most everyone still enjoyed watching the ducks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Tell me your joke today,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane Marie, my wife, had been keeping on me to vet the jokes Todd was learning, for since it was known that Todd was telling jokes, people all over town were happy to tell him new ones, and Jane Marie worried some were not appropriate for all audiences and Todd would get himself in trouble. There had been an incident a few years ago when a little girl was crying outside the swimming pool, and she asked Todd if he could take her in to help her change into her suit, and he said he couldn&#x2019;t and that he was sorry, and when the little girl asked why, Todd explained that the locker room was for women only because, &#x201c;Vaginas were generally considered private and were only really comfortable being exposed to other females in situations such as locker rooms or some public restrooms.&#x201d; Well, the lifeguard on duty heard the last of this, and there was a small-town kerfuffle about his choice of language, and Todd couldn&#x2019;t go to the swimming pool without me for a while, and it caused Jane Marie some heartburn in the joke department.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd took a deep breath and straightened his glasses. &#x201c;A little boy was sitting on the curb in town eating a big handful of chocolate bars, one after another, and an old man comes up to him and says, &#x2018;You know, young man, you really shouldn&#x2019;t eat so much chocolate. It&#x2019;s not good for you,&#x2019; and the little boy says, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, my grandpa lived to be one hundred and three.&#x2019; The old man said, &#x2018;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry, did your grandpa eat a lot of chocolate?&#x2019; and the little boy said, &#x2018;No but he learned to mind his own fucking business.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this time, we were through the roundabout and to the only stoplight downtown, and the wind was hitting us straight on without obstruction from the east. Todd&#x2019;s glasses were now a haze of mist, dotted with raindrops. Though we could have crossed without danger to get undercover on the opposite corner, we waited in the soaking wind because Todd honors all laws.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good joke,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you tell it with anyone under twelve years old around, just change the &#x2018;fuck&#x2019; to &#x2018;damn.&#x2019; You&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd nodded. He had taken many similar notes and understood the F-word problem.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Cecil?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I responded.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why was the little boy eating chocolate bars sitting on the curb of the street?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light changed but just before we stepped down off the curb I considered his question. I never like to brush him off or give him the impression I&#x2019;m not giving his inquiries full consideration.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just funnier. I guess.&#x201d; We hurried across the street.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time we got home the house was in a full frenzy of pre-dinner homework bickering: Jane Marie was stirring a pot of boiling red sauce, and Blossom was standing at the head of a bare table staring into her phone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Cecil, will you talk to your daughter?&#x201d; was my wife&#x2019;s greeting as I topped the stairs to our living room/kitchen, which looked out over the channel. Blossom did not acknowledge my existence.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mi familia!&#x201d; I said as happily as I could. &#x201c;Daughter, is there trouble in paradise?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mom is being a bitch,&#x201d; Blossom said, without raising her heavily mascaraed eyes from her phone, which she appeared to be drumming with her thumbs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane Marie slapped the spoon into the sauce and started to make a move around the stove like a professional wrestler about to climb the turnbuckle to go for a body slam.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Now hold on . . . every one. Hold on.&#x201d; I moved in front of Jane Marie to gather her up in my arms. &#x201c;You <i>are </i>such a bitch. I knew that the first time I met you.&#x201d; I kissed her on the lips.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She can&#x2019;t call me that, Cecil.&#x201d; Jane Marie&#x2019;s eyes were tired and sad, but every muscle in her body was coiled. She was ready to break.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;let me set the table. Blossom, would you please pick some dinner music that will not cause us to slit our wrists, and could we have a meal that does not involve having the police called?&#x201d; Blossom grunted and sat down and started scrolling through her music.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You are such a tool,&#x201d; she muttered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Thank you sweetheart,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advantage of asking Blossom to provide the music for dinner was she had to place her phone in a cradle beside the stereo system. She chose the Mountain Goats album <i>All Hail West Texas </i>because she knew I had once said that I liked it, but she set the volume far too high, knowing it would irritate the shit out of her mother, particularly the chorus of &#x201c;Hail Satan!&#x201d; in the first song. Jane Marie sat gritting her teeth as I scooped the sauce onto her plate, and I signaled Todd to turn down the volume.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To give a little more background to the tension in our family, about nine months ago a girl from the high school had dropped out and then gone missing. Her name was Melissa Bean. She had twin baby girls. We had known her and had helped her with her children. We still took care of the babies when the grandparents were overwhelmed. Melissa had fallen away in the last few months before her disappearance. She had been sullen and quiet, angry most of the time. &#x201c;Drugs,&#x201d; her parents said. She was never home; then there were new friends and strange calls. She was always tired, seemed scared of something but got snappy if you asked her about it. Her mom was worried that her daughter was growing so thin. Finally, after the Permanent Fund checks, our oil money payments, came out she was gone. No rumors. No body. It was a nightmare for Jane Marie and the many mothers of sullen teenage girls.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was worried about Blossom as well, but I always worried. I&#x2019;m now a fifty-six-year-old father of a teenager. I&#x2019;m always tired too. I don&#x2019;t see any of the obvious signs of drug use. Blossom is smart and bookish. She reads a lot. She makes films with her phone. She stays up late watching movies and talking to her nerdy friends. She likes to argue and cares passionately about the things she likes. The druggy people I knew&#x2014;and I knew a lot of them&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t give a whit about John Darnielle, or whether he sounded better solo or with his band, or if the whole &#x201c;lo-fi&#x201d; phenomenon was bullshit or not, but for some reason Blossom did. Now, is she in danger of becoming a pretentious thirteen-year-old hipster? Probably, but Your Honors, cut me some parental slack here. This is Sitka, Alaska, and being a tad pretentious or being a lot pretentious when you are thirteen is a far cry from being a meth head swallowed up by the drug underworld, and preferable to that as well.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Jane Marie worried about it, night and day, particularly since Blossom&#x2019;s dear little playmate Emily dyed her hair blue and, in a twist on her best friend&#x2019;s name, changed her own name to Thistle.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Cecil, can Thistle spend the night tomorrow?&#x201d; Calling us by our first names was another new development that drove Jane Marie crazy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine with me.&#x201d; I looked at Jane Marie and she nodded down at her food. &#x201c;Is it okay with her mom?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah . . . she doesn&#x2019;t live with her mom anymore. She lives someplace else, with another family, I think.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What?&#x201d; Jane Marie put down her fork. &#x201c;Honey, what happened with Emily?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. She just moved out. It happens.&#x201d; Now they were both looking at their food.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Todd asked for some more spaghetti, and I dished him some in silence.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Blossom . . .&#x201d; Jane Marie&#x2019;s voice was starting to crack, &#x201c;when did this happen?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I dunno.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Jesus Christ,&#x201d; Jane Marie said softly and a tear traced down her cheek.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why are you mad at me? I didn&#x2019;t do anything,&#x201d; Blossom said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No one said you did, honeybunny,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Jane Marie said. She got up from the table and put her half-full plate of crab pasta in the sink and walked back into the office. John Darnielle and the Mountain Goats were singing &#x201c;Color in Your Cheeks&#x201d; as Todd asked if he could have another piece of French bread, and I told him he could.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Honors, you know from the previous briefing that I have a criminal history. You know that I am an alcoholic. At the time of this incident I had not had a drink in twenty years. All of my earlier offenses, the offenses that caused me to lose my driving privileges and tarnish my record were all alcohol related. What you may not know is that I was also a child of alcoholics, though my parents were not as extreme or as dramatic in their drinking as I turned out to be. But as a child of an alcoholic, I grew up with a need to please, and a need to try and to set the chaos right, to sweep up the broken glass and smooth over the arguments. Some have suggested that was the reason I became a criminal defense investigator. I don&#x2019;t know about that, but I&#x2019;m sure it helped when it came to being the father of a teenager.</p><h2>Garrett Investigates(Deadly Quicksilver Lies/ Petty Pewter Gods/ Faded Steel Heat)</h2><p>Book Club Hardcover Edition</p><p></p><h2>The Southwest: New Mexico and Arizona (The Smithsonian Guides to Natural America)</h2><p>Featuring glorious color photos and maps throughout, this new edition of the Smithonian Guide to Natural America covers the parks, wilderness preserves, nature sanctuaries and scenic wonders to be found in Arizona and New Mexico.</p><p>orious color photos and maps throughout, this new edition of the Smithonian Guide to Natural America covers the parks, wilderness preserves, nature sanctuaries and scenic wonders to be found in Arizona and New Mexico.</p><h2>A Piece of the World: A Novel</h2><p><p>From the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the smash bestseller <em>Orphan Train,</em> a stunning and atmospheric novel of friendship, passion, and art, inspired by Andrew Wyeth&#x2019;s mysterious and iconic painting <em>Christina&#x2019;s World.</em> </p><p><em>"Later he told me that he&#x2019;d been afraid to show me the painting.

Former monk turned financial advisor, Doug Lynam, shares the rules of money management that will change your approach to earning, saving, and investing.</p><p><em>From Monk to Money Manager</em>&nbsp;is an entertaining and self-deprecating journey through Lynam&#x2019;s relationship with the almighty dollar&#x2014;his childhood in a rich family, the long-haired hippie days running away from materialism, time in the Marine Corps looking for selfless service, and his twenty years in the monastery under a vow of poverty that led to his current profession as a financial advisor. In this unique look at wealth from a spiritual perspective, Lynam shares his belief that God doesn&#x2019;t expect us to live in poverty. The truth is, we need financial peace so we can help others. When money becomes a part of our spiritual practice, used in love and service, it can bring us closer to our highest spiritual ideals.</p><p>With humor and humility, Lynam uses stories told through the lens of his own money mistakes, and those of counseling clients, to understand how our attitudes about money hold us back.

But it wasn't just the incredible beauty of the man that made Claire love him. It wasn't his shoulders, which were the width of a garden-hoe handle, or his thick blond hair and brilliant blue eyes. Nor was it his legs, well muscled from years of riding unruly horses, and exposed to their best advantage beneath the brilliant green kilt. No, it wasn't what she saw that made her sway on her feet: it was what she heard.<br><br>At the sight of the kilt, with the silver-topped sporran hanging from his waist, the ivory-handled dirk in his heavy sock, the tartan thrown over one shoulder and pinned with the laird's badge, she heard a tone man playing the bagpipes. She heard the wind across the fields of heather and the drone of the pipes. She heard the guns of Culloden and the cries of the widows as they grieved for their men. She heard the shouts of joy at victory; the silence of misery at defeat. She heard the sound of hope at the rise of Bonnie Prince Charlie and heard the despair when he was defeated. She heard the treachery of the Campbells, and she heard the long, long wail of pain of the Scots in their centuries-old battle against the English.<br><br>All the sounds echoed in her head as she watched Harry, this man descended from generations of MacArran lairds, walk across the room. The other women saw only an incredibly handsome, dashing young man, but Claire looked beyond that and saw what she heard. She could imagine this blond giant sitting at the head of a heavy oak table, a silver goblet in his hand, flickering firelight reflected on his face as he called on his men to follow him. Here was a leader of men.<br><br>What Harry saw was a short, bosomy young American woman who was pretty, true, but what made her almost beautiftul was the expression on her face. She had a look of eagerness, a look of interest in all things and everyone. When she looked at Harry he felt that he was the only one on earth worth listening to. There was curiosity and intelligence in her big brown eyes. Her small, trim body moved quickly, and she walked with a purposefulness that most women didn't possess.<br><br>Harry quickly came to like the fact that Claire was a girl of action. She couldn't sit still even for a moment and always wanted to go places and see things. Claire suggested outings and ordered the lunch and all Harry and his friends had to do was show up. She made him laugh and she entertained him. Sometimes she talked too much about Scotland's history, but he found it highly amusing that recounting some battle that had taken place over a hundred years ago could bring tears to her eyes. There seemed to be a hundred dead men whom she considered heroic figures, who she said had led lives of great bravery and importance. When she talked of these men, her eyes turned dreamy and unfocused -- so Harry spent that time contemplating her lovely bosom.<br><br>It was when she mentioned that Harry's dead brother was one of her heroes that he sucked a cherry pit down his windpipe and nearly choked to death. Miss Claire Willoughby, never at a loss for action, pushed him over a chair so his belly slammed into the back of it, then she hit him between the shoulder blades so hard the pit flew across the drawing room to land with a splash in the punch bowl.<br><br>It was that action that made Harry know Claire was right for the job. Bramley House needed a mistress who could think and react quickly. And all of Harry's houses needed a mistress who had Claire's money.<br><br>As for Claire, she was stunned at having a Scottish duke pay attention to her. When she was in Harry's presence, she could hardly breathe. She listened to him and looked at him and smiled at him. She said what she hoped he wanted to hear and did what she hoped he wanted her to do. And when she was out of his sight, she thought about him and sighed.<br><br>Claire's mother was beside herself with delight when she found out that her daughter was pining for a man who was a duke. "But he's also the laird of Clan MacArran," Claire said, but that meant nothing to her mother.<br><br>Arva Willoughby had once been a great beauty and now she didn't seem to notice that her flesh bulged above and below her corset. She wasn't going to allow her daughter, who was much too studious for Arva's taste, to miss an opportunity such as this. Arva did everything in her power to instruct her daughter in the art of winning a man.<br><br>For one thing, Arva didn't allow the young people to spend time alone together. Arva said that a man's interest was piqued by absence, not by seeing him every day. She said that a woman saw enough of her husband after they were married, she didn't need to see him <i>before</i> the marriage too.<br><br>"Mother," Claire said, exasperation in her voice. "The duke has not asked me to marry him and how do I know if I <i>want</i> to marry him if I don't get to know him?"<br><br>As usual, Arva had an answer for everything. "You may think you know about life because you've spent your few years with your nose in a book, but you know nothing whatever about men and women."<br><br>Claire was too happy to allow her mother's pessimism to upset her. She smiled and thought of Harry and his ancestors striding across the Scottish Highlands.<br><br>It was only after she'd known Harry for over a month that Claire began to have doubts. "Mother, Harry and I never seem to have anything to talk about. He listens to me and smiles at me, but he never comments on what I say. Sometimes I think His Grace doesn't even know who Bonnie Prince Charlie is."<br><br>"My dear child, whatever are you complaining about? That young man is divine looking and he's a duke. What more could you want?"<br><br>"Someone to talk -- "<br><br>"Hah!" Arva snorted. "What does conversation matter in a marriage? After the first year you never so much as say more than pass the butter, and if you have good servants you don't need to say that much. Your father and I haven't spoken to each other in years and we love each other madly."<br><br>Claire looked down at her book.<br><br>Arva put her hand under her child's chin. "I know what it's like to be young and in love. You have doubts. We all do at your age. But, trust me, there's nothing to worry about. Your young duke is handsome, kind, thoughtful -- just look at the flowers he sent to you last week -- he is everything a woman could ask for. And if he doesn't talk a great deal, that's to your advantage. And you say he listens to you? My dear, a man who listens to a woman is worth his price in diamonds."<br><br>Claire gave her mother a weak smile and Arva took the book from her hands. "You'll ruin your eyes reading so much." She looked at the cover. "And who is Captain Baker?" she asked, naming the author of the book.<br><br>"An explorer. The greatest explorer the world has ever known. It's rumored that he's a relative of the duke's."<br><br>Arva looked at the light in her daughter's eyes and frowned. "Dear, I know what it's like to dream. I, too, had dreams, but I've learned some things in my life. A woman's entire future depends on her husband. These men you dream about, these..." She looked about Claire's bedroom, full of books that were packed and unpacked in trunks wherever the Willoughbys went. "These inventors and artists and writers and this one, this explorer, they aren't men you can live with. There are men you live with and men you -- Well, never mind, you'll find out about that part of life after you are married. I won't have to tell you a thing and I daresay young Harry is worldly enough to be understanding."<br><br>Claire wasn't sure what her mother was talking about, but she knew she didn't like it. "I want to love my husband."<br><br>"Of course you do. And you love Harry, don't you? How could you not?"<br><br>Claire thought of Harry, of the way he looked in his kilt, of the way he looked at her with his blue eyes.<br><br>Arva smiled at her daughter. "And there are other considerations. Think, Claire, what it will be like to be a duchess. Your every whim taken care of before you know you want it. You'll be able to meet all these wayward creatures you read about. How could they turn down an invitation from a duchess? You will have freedom, Claire, freedom to do whatever you want whenever you want to do it." The smile left her face. "And there is the little matter of your grandfather's will. Your father and I approve of young Harry and if you marry him, you will receive your inheritance. If you do not..." She smiled again. "I'm not threatening you, dear, you do what you must, but there is your little sister to consider."<br><br>With that Arva swept from her daughters room, leaving Claire alone. Sometimes her mother seemed like a silly, frivolous woman, a woman of little education and not much brain power. But sometimes her mother almost frightened Claire.<br><br>Claire put Captain Baker's book aside and smoothed her dress. Whatever was she concerned about? Harry, duke of MacArran, was a divine man and, yes, she did love him. As her mother said, how could she not love a man like Harry? There wasn't a thing wrong with him. If a woman were to create the perfect man, she would invent Harry.<br><br>Claire laughed aloud. She was being silly. She was in love with Harry and she was probably going to be a duchess. She was the happiest, luckiest young woman in the world.<br><br>The next Sunday afternoon Harry took Claire out alone on a lake, rowed her to a pretty little island in the middle, and helped her from the little boat. Claire sat upright on a tartan robe that Harry had brought for her, her hands folded on her lap, while he sprawled in the grass beside her. He wore an old-fashioned linen shirt with huge gathered sleeves. The linen looked as if it had been washed a thousand times and was a soft yellow with age. It was laced at the neck with a drawstring and Harry had left it open so that part of his smooth skin was exposed. He wore his green kilt, not the drawing room kilt, but one that was faded with age and use. He made no concessions in his movements to the fact that what he was wearing was actually a skirt; he sat with his legs apart, mounted horses with his usual quick, strong gestures (it was rumored that one young lady had fainted the first time she saw the kilt-clad young duke mount his horse). Now he sprawled on the grass, his kilt spread about him, a four-inch-wide belt about his waist, and looked at Claire.<br><br>"I've grown rather fond of you, you know."<br><br>Claire's heart was in her throat, pounding. She didn't know if it was the man himself, or what he represented to her, or, as her brat of a sister said, if it was the sheer beauty of him, but Harry did odd things to her insides. "I...like you too," she said.<br><br>"I was wondering if you'd like to marry me."<br><br>Claire turned to him, her eyes opened in shock. She had been expecting this, hoping for this moment, but it was still a shock. There was nothing she could think of to say.<br><br>"I know it's asking a great deal," Harry continued. "I have a few monstrous pieces of property, including a hideous old house called Bramley. It's falling apart, and there are a few other problems in my life as well, but I do rather like you."<br><br>Claire began to breathe again, and she tried to swallow the lump in her throat. She wanted to recover herself before she answered. There were times, when she was away from Harry, that she had doubts about their suitability for each other, but not when she was with him. When she was with him, she could only see him and hear the bagpipes in her head.<br><br>She hesitated, not wanting to appear too eager to become his wife. Of course, what she was thinking, as she looked at his strong legs, was that she would climb a snow-covered mountain barefoot if she could marry this heavenly man and become a Scottish duchess. "Is your house very old?" she asked, trying not to allow her voice to squeak.<br><br>Harry leaned his head back, catching the warmth of the sun on his face. His lashes were quite long and thick. "I don't remember. Bramley was built in twelve hundred, thirteen hundred, something like that."<br><br>"It's a castle?"<br><br>"It was at one time. Part of it's old and falling down, but some ancestor of mine built around it."<br><br>It took her a moment to understand what he meant. "Someone put a facade on it? You mean there's a castle hidden inside your house?"<br><br>"Mmmmm," was all he said.<br><br>Claire's imagination ran away with her. She imagined one family having lived in the same house for centuries; she imagined all the history that must be in a house like that. "is Bramley very large?"<br><br>He put his head down and grinned at her, making Claire's heart skip a beat. "I haven't seen all of it."<br><br>A house so large its owner hadn't seen all of it. It was a difficult concept for her to imagine. "Yes," she whispered. "Yes, I will marry you."<br><br>With that Claire could no longer contain herself. She jumped up and began to twirl about, her skirt held to one side. He couldn't help laughing, as she was rather like a puppy in her exuberance. He did so like American girls, they said what they thought and acted on their impulses. "I shall make you the best duchess in the whole world," she said. "You'll see. Oh, heavens, but I think being a duchess will be so very interesting -- "<br><br>He didn't say another word but slowly lifted one of his big hands, put it behind her head, and drew her face down to his for a kiss. Claire had never kissed a man before and she was anxious that she should please him. She tried to follow his lead and do what he wanted her to, but when he pulled her down to him, then pushed her body on top of his, she moved her head away. She had to use some strength to get away from him. When she was at last back on the robe, she was out of breath as she blinked at him. He had a wicked look in his eyes.<br><br>"I don't think I'll mind marriage much after all," he said, and leaned back on his arms again.<br><br>They sat in silence for a while, Claire trying to calm herself. The very oddest thing had happened: when Harry was kissing her, she could no longer hear the pipes.<br><br>"You must come and meet my mother," he said. "It's hunting season and there'll be some shooting. You can stay at Bramley with my family and after a while we'll get married."<br><br>"Yes," was all Claire could say.<br><br>They didn't say any more for a while -- Claire had realized some time ago that Harry didn't like to talk much -- but sat in companionable silence until he said it was time to go. As he helped her into the boat, he kissed her again, softly and sweetly on the lips, then rowed her to the far shore. Claire smiled at him and thought of the future that awaited her.<br><br>What followed were weeks of preparation. Claire's mother was swooning with happiness over her daughter's announcement and the impending visit to stay at Bramley and meet the duchess. Claire wanted to spend every minute of every day with Harry, but Arva had other plans for her daughter. "After you're married you'll spend more than enough time with him. Believe me, you'll see more than you want to see of a man after he's your husband," her mother repeated yet again.<br><br>Claire wasn't about to allow her mother's cynicism to upset her. She saw Harry whenever she could, never alone, but always with other people. They went with four of Harry's friends to choose her engagement ring, a fat blue diamond surrounded by emeralds, and she knew she was going to miss him dreadfully when she went with her parents and sister across the Channel to be fitted for a divine wardrobe by Mr. Worth.<br><br>Claire returned from her first fitting at Worth's Paris salon and looke...</p><h2>In Aunt Lucy&#39;s Kitchen (The Cobble Street Cousins, Book 1)</h2><p>Lily, Rosie, and Tess are making a doll house for their Aunt Lucy that will look just like her flower shop, and their neighbor Michael, who has a crush on Aunt Lucy, has agreed to help them find supplies, as long as they make a Michael doll to keep the Aunt Lucy doll company.</p><p>Cynthia Rylant is the author of more than 100 books for young people, including the beloved Henry and Mudge, Annie and Snowball, Brownie &amp; Pearl, and Mr. Putter &amp; Tabby series.

P.I. Regan Reilly has high hopes for her Aspen vacation. But a mystery soon has the chic detective snooping rather than skiing. Million-dollar paintings have been disappearing, and an old friend of Regan&#39;s-a folksy ex-con named Eben Bean-has vanished too. Everyone except Regan believes Eben has gone bad...again. Her hunt to find him leads away from the tourist crowd into the founding families of this former frontier town. She never expects to get in hot water with a wild and woolly seventy-something lady who has a shocking secret she&#39;d die to keep. Or get in over her head trying to save a famous portrait a dangerous criminal would kill to steal. Now the snow is falling, the plot is thickening, and Regan is engaged in a different winter sport, one that&#39;s right up her alley-trying to catch a thief!</p><p>The frontier spirit is alive and well in the old silver-mining town-turned-trendy resort of Aspen, Colorado, despite an influx of the rich and famous - and Regan Reilly. Regan has arrived with her mystery-writing mom and suave, funeral director father to spend the Christmas holidays on the slopes and visiting friends. Secretly, she wouldn&#39;t mind meeting a single man or two. She never expects to be rubbing shoulders, and maybe risking her neck, with varmints, desperadoes, or art thieves. Million-dollar paintings have been disappearing from elegant condos and chic chalets all over town. Suspicion immediately falls on a congenial ex-con caretaker named Eben Bean, who seems to have absconded with the loot. Worse, Regan not only knew and liked Eben, but also had helped him get his caretaking job. Now she may be the only person in town who believes he is innocent.Carol Higgins Clark is the author ofthe bestselling Regan Reilly mysteries.

These, the man and his work, compose a definite critique of philosophy. His skill is matched by his intensity: his "calling" shines through on every page. <p>Until philosophy leaves its false paths, Bergson demonstrates, it will remain a wordy dialectic, a beating of false problems, and it will never become a search for truth. How this search is to be undertaken is carefully outlined by the author. He builds as he destroys, using the rubble of the old to build the new. His is a philosophy on the move, the rationale of man's spiritual drive, the mind gathering strength from its mastery of the of the material world to contemplate itself, to find at the core of intuition the moving element of discovery and free the possessive sense of novelty. Life is to be grasped in handfuls, but with the sure grasp of discipline.</p></p><h2>This Day In Christian History: 366 Compelling Events in the History of the Church</h2><p><i>This Day in Christian History</i> tells a fascinating story for each day of the year.

But a closer look reveals a complex and <strong>disturbingly anthropomorphic</strong> universe, full of symbols, sly jokes, and allusions to the &#x2019;operatic&#x2019; nature of traditional natural history themes. The beasts and birds populating this contemporary artist&#x2019;s life-size paintings are <strong>never mere objects, but dynamic actors in allegorical struggles</strong>: a wild turkey crushes a small parrot in its claw; a troupe of monkeys wreak havoc on a formal dinner table, an American buffalo is surrounded by bloodied white wolves. The book&#x2019;s title derives from <em>The Pancha Tantra</em>, an ancient Indian book of animal tales considered the precursor to <em>Aesop&#x2019;s Fables</em>.<br> <br> This large-format edition includes <strong>an in-depth exploration of Walton Ford&#x2019;s oeuvre,</strong> a complete biography, and excerpts from his textual inspirations: Vietnamese folktales and the letters of Benjamin Franklin, the <em>Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini</em> and Audubon&#x2019;s <em>Ornithological Biography</em>.<br> <br> <strong>First published in TASCHEN&#x2019;s limited collector&#x2019;s edition &#x2014; now available in this standard hardcover edition!</strong> &nbsp; Text in English, French, and German</p><p>Special features: <br>* Limited to 1,500 individually numbered copies, each signed by Walton Ford <br>* Printed on acid-free paper <br>* Finished in Luxor book cloth with a leather spine and corners with gold embossing <br>* Packaged in a clamshell box covered in Luxor book clothWalton Ford grew up in Westchester County, New York, in a family of gifted storytellers. As a child he was an amateur naturalist--collecting animals, hiking, fishing, and devoting much of his free time to examining and drawing the dioramas and specimens at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He completed his studies in filmmaking at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1982, but soon adapted his talent for storytelling to painting. His life-size watercolors, which at first glance appear to be in the vein of 19th-century natural-history painters like John J. Audubon or Edward Lear, are actually complexly layered fantasies depicting wild animals in unnatural settings and situations, and cite textual sources ranging from the letters of Benjamin Franklin to the journals of Leonardo da Vinci. Ford lived in New York City for most of the 1980s and &#39;90s--home base for personally and professional influential travels to countries including Italy, India, and Mexico--and for some years supported himself as a wood refinisher, carpenter, metalworker, and illustrator, while developing his craft and audience. His work has been exhibited widely since 1987 at private galleries and public institutions including The Whitney Museum, The Brooklyn Museum, the Paul Kasmin Gallery in New York, Michael Cohn Gallery in Los Angeles. He has been awarded a John Simon Guggenheim fellowship and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Foundation for the Arts, among others. He now lives, works, and hikes in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.</p><h2>C&amp;T Publishing Paper Piecing with Alex Anderson</h2><p>Now full revised and updated, this 50,000-copy bestseller is the ultimate guide to paper piecing for beginners.

If you have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques; and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about. It&#x2019;s about learning to pay attention.&#x201d;<br><b>--Anne Lamott, Mademoiselle</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The premise of the book is that creativity and spirituality are the same thing, they come from the same place. And we were created to use this life to express our individuality, and that over the course of a lifetime that gets beaten out of us. [<b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b>] helped me put aside my fear and not worry about whether the record would be commercial.&#x201d;<br><b>--Grammy award-winning singer Kathy Mattea</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Julia Cameron brings creativity and spirituality together with the same kind of step-by-step wisdom that Edgar Cayce encouraged. The result is spiritual creativity as a consistent and nourishing part of daily life.&#x201d;<br><b>--Venture Inward</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I never knew I was a visual artist until I read Julia Cameron&#x2019;s <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b>.&#x201d;<br><b>--Jannene Behl in Artist&#x2019;s Magazine</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Julia Cameron&#x2019;s landmark book <b>THE ARTIST&#x2019;S WAY</b> helped me figure out who I really was as an adult, not so much as an artist but as a person. And award-winning journalist and poet, Cameron&#x2019;s genius is that she doesn&#x2019;t tell readers what they should do to achieve or who they should be&#x2014;instead she creates a map for readers to start exploring these questions themselves.&#x201d;<br><b>--Michael F. Melcher, Law Practice magazine</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This is not a self-help book in the normative sense.

The Englishman&#39;s home is more than his castle. It is his face, his refuge and his family hearth.&#39; So says Simon Jenkins, who set out to create a list that is almost impossible to concoct - the thousand best houses in England. but by &#34;best&#34;, Jenkin&#39;s doesn&#39;t mean big or grand - best means ambiance, character, that unique feeling of being lovingly lived in. And so his list includes everything from Buckingham Palace (three stars) to a small Georgian house in Spitalfield 9four stars), and castles, rectories, farm cottages and prefabs... All English human life is here to be enjoyed. &#39;The houses of England,&#39; says Jenkins, &#39;are a treasure trove, a glory of humanity, a wonder of the world.&#34; Alright, he might be lacing it a bit with land of hope and glory and all that, but Jenkins has travelled throughout England, from Cornwall to Cumbria, to choose its most impressive, interesting and unusual houses. Not only does he include a full, rich selection of its great and famous houses and estates, but also presents an eclectic mix from the many thousands of towers, castles, halls, abbeys, cottages, private homes - even schools and prisons - of the country. From Blenheim Palace to Milton&#39;s Cottage, from Chatsworth to John Lennon&#39;s childhood home, from Spencer House to a tiny hop-pickers&#39; shack in Kent, every architectural style and period is included, and setting for almost every kind of English life.

But what do we really know of the men and women who made the windows, and the methods they used? Stained glass was an invaluable medium for communicating religion to a largely illiterate populace and the glass-painter was its creator. This book describes the fascinating origins of the craft and the techniques employed - including the design, colouring, and use of pattern books. The authors explain the circumstances of commission, who the patrons were, and how the glass-painter both designed and executed the window. They then discuss evidence of the education, position in society, and working practices of glass-painters. Finally, they recount the decline of this resplendent craft and the sad destruction of the windows as the Reformation and changes in fashion both took their toll. Beautifully illustrated with examples from cathedrals, churches, and castles throughout Europe, this book will enrich the understanding of all lovers of medieval art and architecture.&#34;</p><p><b>Sarah Brown</b> is a senior archivist in the architectural section of the Royal Commission on the Historial Monuments of England.<p></p><br><br><b>David O'Connor</b> is a lecturer in the history of art at the University of Manchester.<p></p></p><h2>Sinister Sprinkles: A Donut Shop Mystery (Donut Shop Mysteries)</h2><p><p>Just in time for the Winter Festival, a glistening layer of snow has covered the streets of April Springs, North Carolina.

She and her father are among the thousands of Jewish refugees scrambling over the Alps toward Italy, where they hope to be safe at last, now that the Italians have broken with Germany and made a separate peace with the Allies. The Blums will soon discover that Italy is anything but peaceful, as it becomes overnight an open battleground among the Nazis, the Allies, resistance fighters, Jews in hiding, and ordinary Italian civilians trying to survive.<br><br>Mary Doria Russell sets her first historical novel against this dramatic background, tracing the lives of a handful of fascinating characters. Through them, she tells the little-known but true story of the network of Italian citizens who saved the lives of forty-three thousand Jews during the war&#x2019;s final phase. The result of five years of meticulous research, <i>A Thread of Grace</i> is an ambitious, engrossing novel of ideas, history, and marvelous characters that will please Russell&#x2019;s many fans and earn her even more.</p><p>Mary Doria Russell's extraordinary and complex historical novel, <i>A Thread of Grace</i>, is the kind of book that you will find yourself haunted by long after finishing the last page. It opens with a group of Jewish refugees being escorted to safe-keeping by Italian soldiers. After making the arduous journey over a steep mountain pass, they are welcomed into a small village with warm food and clean beds. They have barely laid their heads to rest when news is received that Mussolini has just surrendered Italy to Hitler, putting them in danger yet again. This opening sequence is a grim foreshadowing of the heart-breaking journey these characters will experience in their struggle for survival. <p> The rich fictional narrative is woven through the factual military maneuvers and political games at the end of WW II, sharing a little-known story of a group of Italian citizens that sheltered more than 40,000 Jews from grueling work camp executions. Rather than the bleak and hopeless feeling that might be expected, the novel has the opposite effect; it reminds us that just as there will always be war, crime, and death, so too will there be good people who selflessly sacrifice themselves to ease the suffering of others. Perhaps best of all, Russell succinctly opens and closes her writing with short pieces that bookend the story with the force of a freight train. Her moving finale wraps up her narrative in the present day, with a death bed scene that's sure to rip the heart out of readers of every faith and ancestry.</p><p> On the surface, Russell's third novel may seem quite different from her earlier works. Both <i>The Sparrow</i> and its sequel, <i>Children of God</i> , were futuristic stories about Earth's first contact with alien life forms, but a closer look reveals several similarities. Fans of her earlier books will be pleased to find that Emilio Sandoz, the charismatic Jesuit priest from the first two books, finds new life in Renzo Leoni--<i>A Thread of Grace</i>'s charming and haunted chameleon. The two have different circumstances and histories, but both characters are made of the same cloth--tormented by their consciences and plagued by unrequited love. Also similar to her earlier books, the characters in <i>A Thread of Grace</i> don't all enjoy a happy ending. A note in the reader's guide tells us that Russell flipped a coin to determine the fate of some of the characters. This may be upsetting for many readers, particularly those used to Hollywood endings, but it does serve as a frank reminder of the arbitrary nature of war and death. <i>--Victoria Griffith</i></p>The author of prize-winning research in paleoanthropology,<b> Mary Doria Russell </b>has written two previous novels, <i>The Sparrow </i>and<i> Children of God</i>.

Beyond Fort Bridger, Captain Donner led a large party through a much-advertised shortcut. Delays and difficulties caused them to be snowbound in the High Sierras, facing the grim specter of starvation and extreme suffering.&nbsp;Though only four years old at the time of the expedition, the captain&#x2019;s youngest daughter, Eliza Donner, would never forget the excitement of crossing the prairies&#x2014;or the horror of that winter. Details impressed on her young mind were later substantiated by the recollections of her older sisters and other survivors. Her book, originally published in 1911, is an intimate and authoritative account of the Donner disaster. George and Tamsen Donner and those who shared their fate are fully humanized in the telling. Eliza also relates what happened to her and a sister after being rescued and what it was like to grow up in a world that turned the Donners into a grisly legend.</p><p>Kristin Johnson is a librarian at Salt Lake City Community College and the author of <i>Unfortunate Emigrants: Narratives of the Donner Party.</i>&#x201c;[Those in the Donner camp] could scarcely walk, by the twenty-eighth, and their sensations of hunger were diminishing.

Donner Houghton (Eliza P. Donner Houghton)</p><h2>The Female Detective (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p>In 1864, the British writer James Redding Ware, under the pseudonym Andrew Forrester, published <i>The Female Detective</i>, introducing readers to the first professional female detective character, Mrs. Gladden, and paving the way for the more famous female detectives of the early twentieth century, namely Miss Marple and Nancy Drew.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Mrs. Gladden's deductive methods anticipate those of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, who would not appear for another twenty years--and like Holmes, she regards the regular constabulary with disdain. But her energetic and savvy approach to solving crimes is her greatest appeal, and the reappearance of the original lady detective is sure to captivate a new generation of crime fiction fans.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> In 2012 <i>The Female Detective </i>was made available to the general public for the first time since its original publication; the British Library is now reissuing this foundational crime novel as part of its Crime Classics series.</p><p><b>Andrew Forrester </b>is the pseudonym of James Redding Ware (1832-c.1909). During his early career he wrote a number of detective stories, including <i>Secret Service, or, Recollections of a City Detective</i> and <i>Revelations of the Private Detective</i>.The stories are varied in subject and style; some are recognizable as traditional detective fiction, some more anecdotal and not directly related to Miss B. I enjoyed reading them all. (Nancy A Bekofske <i>The Literate Quilter</i>)<br><br>This book is going to make a lot of literary critics and scholars happy because there&#x2019;s so much to dig through. (Annie Smith <i>A Bookish Type</i>)<br><br>This book has fabulous historic value of the writing of the time, both in writing style and how stories where told. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>The latest reprint in the British Library Crime Classics is one of the earliest: a cycle of stories about a London detective first published in 1864, here introduced by Alexander McCall Smith, who ventures general remarks about female detectives, and Mike Ashley, who supplies some uncommonly informative historical background. Even her closest friends think she's a milliner, but Miss Gladden&#x2014;not her real name, but "the name I assume most frequently while in my business" &#x2014;can look back with pride on her secret career as a professional inquiry agent with a subtly shifting relationship to the Metropolitan Police. In "The Unknown Weapon," her inquiries help the police discover who murdered young squire Graham Petleigh in his father's manor house. In "The Judgment of Conscience," she's able to set the police straight about a lower-class romantic triangle that ends in tragedy. In "Tenant for Life," her unofficial investigation, launched when she overhears a friend's chance remark to her cabman husband about "Little Fourpenny Number Two way," uncovers a plot to defraud the legal heir of a sizable estate. And her only role in the fact-based "A Child Found Dead: Murder Or No Murder" is to introduce a doctor friend who introduces his own childhood friend, Hardal, who does the sleuthing honors when a young boy taken from his bed is found dead nearby. "Georgy" ruefully recounts a blithe embezzler's success in eluding both his conscience and any legal consequences of his theft. The most strikingly modern notes struck throughout all the stories, in fact, are Miss Gladden's frequent failure to bring wrongdoers to justice and her regrets over the outcomes of her cases. The creaking dialogue and halting, step-by-step-by-step deductions, which guarantee a glacial pace, will keep most of the curious at bay; this is no overlooked gem. But feminists and historical completists, the most likely readers to persevere, will find themselves amply rewarded by detective tales that more often focus on how and why than whodunit. (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>It's easy to read and quite enjoyable. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>Another fantastic classic from the British library classic crime collection. I can never fail to be riveted by these titles and the Female Detective is no exception. Perfect for fans of Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christie. A engrossing classic crime to keep readers old and new alike hooked and booked for hours. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>There are plenty of touches of humour and an excellent knowledge of human nature in the stories (Jill Weekes <i>Jillysheep</i>)<br><br>I liked flow and her use of the English language in setting the mood and the characters. (Arlene Caney <i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>The Female Detective is the first novel in British fiction to feature a professional female detective. Written by Andrew Forrester, it was originally published in 1864. The protagonist is Miss Gladden, or &#x2018;G&#x2019; as she is also known the precursor to Miss Marple, Mma Ramotswe and Lisbeth Salander. Miss Gladden&#x2019;s deductive methods and energetic approach anticipate those of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s Sherlock Holmes, and she can be seen as beginning a powerful tradition of female detectives in these seven short stories. &#x2018;G&#x2019; uses similar methods to her male counterparts she enters scenes of crime incognito, tracking down killers while trying to conceal her own tracks and her identity from others. &#x2018;G&#x2019;, the first female detective, does much physical detective work, examining crime scenes, looking for clues and employing all manner of skill, subterfuge, observation and charm solve crimes. Like Holmes, &#x2018;G&#x2019; regards the regular constabulary with disdain. For all the intrigue and interest of the stories, little is ever revealed about &#x2018;G&#x2019; herself, and her personal circumstances remain a mystery throughout. But it is her ability to apply her considerable energy and intelligence to solve crimes that is her greatest appeal, and the reappearance of the original lady detective will be welcomed by fans of crime fiction.

But it was not the first inquisition nor the last, as Cullen Murphy shows in this far-ranging, informed, and (dare one say?) witty account of its reach down to our own time, in worldly affairs more than ecclesiastical ones.&#x201d; &#x2014; Margaret O&#x2019;Brien Steinfels, former editor, <i>Commonweal</i> <br><br>The Inquisition conducted its last execution in 1826 &#x2014; the victim was a Spanish schoolmaster convicted of heresy. But as Cullen Murphy shows in this provocative new work, not only did its offices survive into the twentieth century, in the modern world its spirit is more influential than ever. <br><i><br>God&#x2019;s Jury</i> encompasses the diverse stories of the Knights Templar, Torquemada, Galileo, and Graham Greene. Established by the Catholic Church in 1231, the Inquisition continued in one form or another for almost seven hundred years. Though associated with the persecution of heretics and Jews &#x2014; and with burning at the stake &#x2014; its targets were more numerous and its techniques more ambitious. The Inquisition pioneered surveillance and censorship and &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; interrogation. As time went on, its methods and mindset spread far beyond the Church to become tools of secular persecution. Traveling from freshly opened Vatican archives to the detention camps of Guant�namo to the filing cabinets of the Third Reich, Murphy traces the Inquisition and its legacy. <br><br>With the combination of vivid immediacy and learned analysis that characterized his acclaimed <i>Are We Rome?</i>, Murphy puts a human face on a familiar but little-known piece of our past, and argues that only by understanding the Inquisition can we hope to explain the making of the present.</p><p><strong> Amazon Exclusive: A Q&amp;A with Author Cullen Murphy</strong> <br> <br> <p><strong>Q: Why the Inquisition&#x2014;and why now? </strong> </p><p><strong> A:</strong> This question gets to the very heart of the book. We&#x2019;ve all heard of the Inquisition&#x2014;and we all remember the Monty Python line, "No one expects the Spanish Inquisition"&#x2014;but we tend to think of it as something safely confined to the past, something "medieval" that in an enlightened age we&#x2019;ve moved far beyond. But that&#x2019;s exactly the wrong way to think about the Inquisition. Rather than some throwback, it&#x2019;s really one of the first &#x201c;modern&#x201d; institutions. This attempt by the Catholic Church to deal with its enemies, inside and outside, made use of tools that hadn&#x2019;t really existed before, tools that have only improved and that are part of our lives today.</p> <br><strong>Q: Like what? </strong><br> <p><strong>A:</strong> Well, let&#x2019;s start with what an inquisition is: it&#x2019;s a disciplinary effort designed to enforce a particular point of view, and it&#x2019;s built in such a way that it can last for a long time&#x2014;in this case, for centuries. To last for a long time you need to have some sort of functioning bureaucracy. You need to have trained people&#x2014;"technocrats," we might call them today&#x2014;who can run the machinery, and you need to be able to keep training new people. You need to be able to watch and keep track of individuals, know what they think, collect and store information, and then be able to put your hands on the information when you need it&#x2014;you need what today we&#x2019;d call search engines. And you need to be able to exert control over ideas you don&#x2019;t like&#x2014;in a word, censorship. It&#x2019;s quite a feat of organization. We take these kinds of capabilities for granted today. With the Inquisition, you can watch them being invented.</p> <p><strong>Q: Go back to the beginning and fill us in&#x2014;when did the Inquisition start, and why?</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Over a period of about seven hundred years, there were many Inquisitions mounted under Church auspices, and they varied in intensity from era to era and place to place. That said, you can divide the Inquisition into three basic phases. The first of them, called the Medieval Inquisition, is usually given a starting date of 1231, when the pope issued certain founding decrees. It was mainly concerned with Christian heretics, especially in southern France, whom the Church saw as a growing threat. Then, in the late fifteenth century, came the Spanish Inquisition. It was run by clerics but effectively controlled by the Spanish crown, not by the pope, and its main targets were Jews and to a lesser extent Muslims. After that, in the mid-sixteenth century, came the Roman Inquisition, which was run from the Vatican, and was mainly concerned with Protestants. This is a very simplified outline. And all kinds of people were caught up in the Inquisition&#x2019;s machinery&#x2014;Jews and heretics, yes, but also witches, homosexuals, rationalists, and intellectuals. </p> <p><strong>Q: How did the Inquisition work? </strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> In the early days inquisitors would arrive in a particular locale and ask people to come forward to confess their misdeeds or to point the finger at others. Because there was a "sell by" date&#x2014;anyone who came forward by a certain time would be treated with lenience&#x2014;a dynamic of denunciation was set into motion. Interrogation was at the center of the inquisitorial process&#x2014;hence the Inquisition&#x2019;s name. The accused was not told the charges against him or the names of the witnesses. The questioning often made use of torture. Detailed records were kept. Most of those who came before tribunals received sentences short of death&#x2014;for instance, they had to wear a special penitential gown for a year or two. But tens of thousands were burned at the stake for their beliefs. In all, hundreds of thousands of people passed through the tribunal process. The psychological imprint on society would have been profound. And as time went on, the Inquisition in some places became a fixture, with its own buildings and with officials in permanent residence. In some places, the networks of informers were complex and dense. </p> <p><strong>Q: Burning at the stake frankly doesn&#x2019;t seem all that contemporary. Why do you say that the Inquisition is essentially "modern"? </strong></p> <p><strong> A:</strong> I&#x2019;ll start by asking a different question: why was there suddenly an Inquisition when there hadn&#x2019;t been one before? After all, intolerance, hatred, and suspicion of the "other," often based on religious and ethnic differences, had always been with us. Throughout history, these realities had led to persecution and violence. But the ability to sustain a persecution&#x2014;to give it staying power by giving it an institutional life&#x2014;did not appear until the Middle Ages. Until then, the tools to stoke and manage those omnipresent embers of hatred did not exist. Once these capabilities do exist, inquisitions become a fact of life. They are not confined to religion; they are political as well&#x2014;just look at the totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century. Or, on a far lesser scale, the anti-communist witch hunts. The targets can be large or small. An inquisition impulse can quietly take root in the very systems of government and civil society that order our lives.</p> <p> Let&#x2019;s think about those tools&#x2014;the ability to put people under surveillance; to compile records and databases, to conduct systematic interrogations, to bend the law to your needs, to lodge your activities in the hands of a self- perpetuating bureaucracy, and to underpin all this with an ideology of moral certainty. The modern world has advanced far beyond the medieval one on all these fronts. Look at what governments can do when it comes to listening in on private conversations, or what corporations can do to distill personal information from the Internet, or what law enforcement can do on a hint of a suspicion.</p> <p><strong>Q: In the wake of 9/11, torture has certainly made a comeback.</strong> </p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it has, and it has done so for the same reason it always does: when the stakes seem very high, and when the people who want to do the torturing believe fervently that their larger cause has the full weight of morality on its side, then all other considerations are irrelevant. If you&#x2019;re absolutely certain that your cause is blessed by God or history, and that it&#x2019;s under mortal threat, then in some minds torture becomes easy to justify. The Inquisition tried to put limits on torture, but the limits were always pushed. Thus, if the rules said you could torture only once, you could get around that obstacle by defining a second session of torture as a "continuance" of the first session. </p> <p>That&#x2019;s how it is with torture&#x2014;once it&#x2019;s deemed permissible in some special situation, the bounds of permissibility keep being stretched. There&#x2019;s always some desired piece of information just beyond reach, and there&#x2019;s always the hope that one more little turn of the screw will secure it. The Bush administration pushed the limits not only in practice but also in theory. In its view, an act wasn&#x2019;t torture unless it caused organ failure, permanent impairment, or death. Ironically, that&#x2019;s a far narrower definition than what the Inquisition would have accepted. The Inquisition understood that torture began well short of that threshold&#x2014;and if it was reached, it had to stop. </p> <p></p>&#x201c;<i>God&#x2019;s Jury</i> is a reminder, and we need to be constantly reminded, that the most dangerous people in the world are the righteous, and when they wield real power, look out. At once global and chillingly intimate in its reach, the Inquisition turns out to have been both more and less awful than we thought. Murphy wears his erudition lightly, writes with quiet wit, and has a delightful way of seeing the past in the present.&#x201d; &#x2014; Mark Bowden, author of <i>Guest of the Ayatollah</i><br><br> &#x201c;Cullen Murphy&#x2019;s account of the Inquisition is a dark but riveting tale, told with luminous grace. The Inquisition, he shows us, represents more than a historical episode of religious persecution. The drive to root out heresy and sin, once and for all, is emblematic of the modern age and a persisting danger in our time.&#x201d; &#x2014; Michael J. Sandel, author of <i>Justice: What&#x2019;s the Right Thing to Do?</i><br><br> &#x201c;When virtue arms itself, beware! Lucid, scholarly, elegantly told, <i>God&#x2019;s Jury</i> is as gripping as it is important.&#x201d; &#x2014; James Carroll, author of <i>Jerusalem, Jerusalem</i><br><br> &#x201c;From Torquemada to Guant�namo and beyond, Cullen Murphy finds the &#x201c;inquisitorial impulse&#x2019; alive, and only too well, in our world.

It happened a lot that year. BYU led the nation in offense, scoring more than five hundred points, thanks to the arm of two-�time all-�American quarterback Jim McMahon. On his way to setting seventy NCAA passing records, McMahon had put Provo, Utah, on the college football map.<br><br>Twenty-�year-�old Sharon Smith hardly noticed. But one evening that fall she was outside her apartment when a rugged-�looking guy with wavy, shoulder-�length hair approached. He introduced himself as Mike Leach, a twenty-�year-�old junior from Cody, Wyoming. He lived in the apartment complex next door. They even used the same laundry room. Turned out they had been neighbors for months.<br><br>Smith was surprised they had never crossed paths. But Leach traveled a fair amount. He was a member of BYU&#x2019;s rugby team.<br><br>She was intrigued. Leach didn&#x2019;t look like a BYU student. For one thing, his hair was too long. It should have been above his collar, according to BYU&#x2019;s honor code. But Leach ignored the rule. That got him repeatedly summoned to the dean&#x2019;s office. Still, Leach didn&#x2019;t cut his hair. He didn&#x2019;t talk like a BYU student either. His vocabulary was a little more colorful. So was his upbringing. He grew up in Wyoming with boys who spent Friday nights popping beers and getting in fistfights. Ranchers wearing sidearms would come into town for lunch at the local diner. Gunsmoke reruns were all the rage. Marshal Dillon was Leach&#x2019;s boyhood hero.<br><br>Smith had met lots of guys at BYU. None was as authentic&#x2014;�or as funny&#x2014;�as Leach. They ended up talking until after midnight, and she accepted his invitation to go out the following night.<br><br>Their first date was a meal at an A&amp;W restaurant in Provo. That&#x2019;s when college football entered the picture. Over hot dogs and a couple cold root beers, Leach started talking about coaching. His idol was BYU&#x2019;s head coach, LaVell Edwards. During Leach&#x2019;s freshman year he had entered his name in a drawing and won season tickets on the forty-�yard line. From that perch he began studying BYU&#x2019;s offensive scheme: a controlled passing game with somebody always in motion before the snap; lots of receivers running a combination of vertical routes and crossing patterns; throwing to the backs in the flat. Edwards&#x2019;s innovative system was a forerunner of the West Coast Offense ultimately popularized by Bill Walsh in the NFL. But at the college level in the early 1980s, no defensive coordinator in the country had figured out how to stop it.<br><br>To the casual fan BYU&#x2019;s system looked pretty complicated. And to a certain extent, it was. But Leach had figured out that the genius of Edwards was the way he packaged his plays. He used an endless number of formations to disguise about fifty basic plays. That made it easy for the offense to memorize and difficult for defenses to recognize.<br><br>Smith had no idea what Leach was talking about. But one thing was obvious to her: the guy sitting across from her sipping root beer through a straw was no casual fan of the game. He wasn&#x2019;t some armchair quarterback either. In high school Leach had started a &#x201c;coaching&#x201d; file, filling it with newspaper clippings from the sports pages and schematic ideas he scribbled on loose sheets of paper. By the time he got to Provo and could watch LaVell Edwards up close, he was mapping out his future. &#x201c;BYU had a state-�of-�the-�art offense,&#x201d; Leach said. &#x201c;The best in the country. I started studying it very closely. LaVell Edwards had a major impact on me.&#x201d;<br>After one date with Leach, Smith never saw anyone else. &#x201c;Of all the people I dated at BYU, he was the only guy who knew exactly what he wanted to do,&#x201d; Smith said. &#x201c;He told me right away that he knew he was going to be a lawyer or a college football coach. I found it very attractive that he had a plan and was very confident about achieving it.&#x201d;<br><br>Never mind that Leach had never played college football and his only coaching experience was as a Little League baseball coach back in Wyoming. Smith wasn&#x2019;t worried. &#x201c;He could analyze the game and the way coaches were coaching, and he had it in his mind that he could do it better at a young age,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Confidence is a very attractive feature.&#x201d;<br><br>In June 1982, Mike and Sharon were married in St. George, Utah. After BYU, they moved to Southern California, and Mike attended law school at Pepperdine. But just before he got his law degree, he posed a practical question to Sharon: &#x201c;Do you want me to come home miserable and making a lot of money or come home happy and not earning as much money?&#x201d;<br><br>She told him that being happy was more important than making a lot of money.<br><br>Leach didn&#x2019;t bother taking the bar exam. Instead, he and Sharon headed to Alabama so Mike could attend the U.S. Sports Academy. After he obtained his master&#x2019;s, they returned to California, and Mike talked his way into a part-�time assistant&#x2019;s position with the football team at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, then a Division II school. The fact that Leach had a law degree intrigued the head coach enough to offer him a job helping out for $3,000. Sharon figured that was a monthly salary. But it was $3,000 for the season.<br><br>With a one-�year-�old baby, the Leaches moved into campus housing. Their bed was a floor mattress. They didn&#x2019;t own a television. Their motto was &#x201c;Opportunity trumps money.&#x201d;<br><br>After one season, the head coach at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo predicted that Leach would develop into a big-�time college football coach. Over the next decade Mike and Sharon crisscrossed the country, taking coaching jobs at College of the Desert in California, Iowa Wesleyan and Valdosta State. Leach even spent a year coaching football in Finland. He held every position from offensive line coach to linebacker coach to quarterback coach. He even served as sports information director and equipment manager at one school. And when all the other coaches left at the end of the day, Leach stayed behind to watch film&#x2014;�always alone, sometimes until dawn&#x2014;�night after night.<br>For the first fifteen years of marriage, Sharon made more money doing clerical work and miscellaneous jobs than Mike made coaching. They were happy but broke. Plus, they were up to three kids with a fourth on the way. Then things changed in 1997. Kentucky&#x2019;s head coach, Hal Mumme, hired Leach as his offensive coordinator. Suddenly Leach jumped from small schools in the middle of nowhere to the SEC, the best conference in college football. His offensive scheme&#x2014;�referred to as &#x201c;the spread&#x201d;&#x2014;�would be tested against Florida, Alabama, Georgia, LSU, Tennessee and Auburn.<br><br>Working under Mumme and drawing from the BYU offense he&#x2019;d studied in the early 1980s, Leach added new wrinkles that opened up the field even more, making it easier for his quarterback to throw into open passing lanes. &#x201c;I spend more time trying to make my offense easy for the quarterback to memorize than anything,&#x201d; Leach said. &#x201c;I want to make it as simple as possible because I want guys to trigger as quick as possible. The key isn&#x2019;t finding good plays. The key is packaging.&#x201d;<br><br>One of the most revolutionary aspects of Leach&#x2019;s system was spacing the offensive linemen three feet apart. At first glance, it appears to give pass rushers a clear shot at the quarterback. But the result was fewer sacks and cleaner passing lanes for the quarterback. The SEC had never seen anything like it. In Leach&#x2019;s first season as offensive coordinator, Kentucky upset Alabama and finished the year with the No. 1 offense in the country, led by quarterback Tim Couch. The following year Kentucky knocked off LSU; Couch threw for more than four thousand yards and went on to become the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft. Meanwhile, Leach&#x2019;s offense set six NCAA records and forty-�one SEC records. The Wildcats had a winning record in the toughest conference in the country.<br><br>Coaches in the SEC weren&#x2019;t the only ones who noticed. Coaches from around the country&#x2014;�including Urban Meyer at Notre Dame, Tommy Bowden at Tulane and Mark Mangino at Kansas State&#x2014;�traveled to Kentucky to learn more about Leach&#x2019;s system. Even a number of NFL coaches made the trek to Lexington. The interest level was so high that Leach made an instructional video on the finer points of throwing and receiving techniques. It sold thousands of copies.<br><br>After two seasons at Kentucky, Leach accepted the position as offensive coordinator at Oklahoma. He was there less than one year before he got offered the head job at Texas Tech. The opportunity had some downside. It was 1999 and Tech was on academic probation for recruiting violations, academic fraud and unethical conduct. Eighteen scholarships were stripped from the football program between 1999 and 2001. Not only would Leach be competing against Texas, Oklahoma and Texas A&amp;M, but he&#x2019;d be doing it with eighteen fewer scholarships for his first three seasons.<br><br>There were other problems. Tech&#x2019;s graduation rates were among the lowest in the nation. Leach held two advanced degrees and had no interest in a football culture that ignored the importance of academics.<br><br>Plus, there was the unenviable task of replacing Tech&#x2019;s Spike Dykes, who had won more games&#x2014;�eighty-�two&#x2014;�than any football coach in the history of the school. In Lubbock, where football is right beside God in importance, Dykes was beloved.<br><br>Despite all this, Leach said yes. At thirty-�eight, a guy who never played college football was off to Lubbock to coach the Red Raiders in the Big 12.<br>Six years later, a cup of coffee in one hand and a remote control in the other, Mike Leach was alone in his office going over game film. Play. Pause. Rewind. Play. Pause. Rewind. Next sequence.<br><br>It was after midnight when he stood up to stretch his legs. He parted the blinds on his office window that overlooked the Texas Tech practice facility. That&#x2019;s when he spotted a shadow moving across the field. It was a human shadow. &#x201c;Who in the hell is that?&#x201d; he mumbled.<br><br>The facilities were locked, the lights off. The place was deserted. Leach wondered if it was a prowler. He headed downstairs to have a look.<br><br>Approaching the field, Leach spotted tiny orange cones. They were arranged in rows. Someone was darting in and out of them. Suddenly the figure came into focus.<br><br>&#x201c;Michael?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, hey, Coach.&#x201d;<br><br>It was Tech receiver Michael Crabtree, considered the top wideout in the country.<br><br>&#x201c;Michael, what are you doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I got to thinking about the corner route,&#x201d; he said in between deep breaths. &#x201c;If I come out of my cut like this&#x201d;&#x2014;�Crabtree pointed his toes and jigged hard to the right&#x2014;�&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be open every time.&#x201d;<br><br>Impressed, Leach folded his arms and nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Crabtree continued, &#x201c;I set up some cones, and I&#x2019;m out here working on it.&#x201d;<br><br>Leach&#x2019;s eyes went from Crabtree to the cones and back to Crabtree. The most talented wide receiver in college football was alone in the dark. There was no ball. No quarterback. No position coach to tell him what to do. It was just Crabtree in his stance, doing starts and stops, running in and out of cones.<br><br>The truth was that Crabtree worked out alone at night a lot. He lived across the street from the practice complex and would sneak in after dark. &#x201c;I always worked on my game,&#x201d; Crabtree said. &#x201c;Coach Leach just happened to catch me that night.&#x201d;<br><br>Determined not to disrupt hard work, Leach turned and headed back inside without saying another word.<br><br>Leach and Crabtree had the kind of relationship that didn&#x2019;t require much talk. When Leach arrived in Lubbock six years earlier, Tech didn&#x2019;t land blue-�chip recruits like Crabtree. A star quarterback at David W. Carter High School in Dallas, Crabtree was also one of the top high school basketball players in the state. Bobby Knight offered him a basketball scholarship. And Texas, Oklahoma, Texas A&amp;M and LSU were all over him with scholarship offers to play football. Tech&#x2019;s facilities couldn&#x2019;t compete with those schools&#x2019;. And Leach&#x2019;s budget was a fraction of his rivals&#x2019;.<br><br>Still, Leach was winning with guys who had been passed over by the Longhorns and the Sooners and the Aggies. In Leach&#x2019;s first six seasons, Tech had gone 49-�28, appeared in six straight bowl games and finished in the top twenty in both 2004 and 2005. But the thing that really got Crabtree&#x2019;s attention was Leach&#x2019;s Air Raid offense. &#x201c;They threw the ball every play,&#x201d; Crabtree said. &#x201c;Leach had the whole program going. I said to myself, &#x2018;Man, if I go to Tech, it&#x2019;s gonna be on.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Tech indeed had the most explosive offense in the country when Leach started recruiting Crabtree in 2004. That year, Tech&#x2019;s football scores often looked like basketball scores. The Red Raiders put up seventy points against TCU. Then they put up seventy against Nebraska, marking the most points scored against the Cornhuskers in the program&#x2019;s 114-�year history. Virtually every Tech game was an offensive exhibition, and Leach&#x2019;s quarterbacks were leading the nation in passing year in and year out.<br><br>But Leach told Crabtree up front that he planned to play him at receiver, not quarterback. Crabtree had been the best athlete on his high school team, and&#x2014;�as is often the case for superior high school athletes&#x2014;�he got asked to play quarterback. But Leach saw in him all the raw materials to make a great receiver&#x2014;�breakaway speed, great leaping ability, big hands and fearlessness. He went as far as to tell Crabtree that he could see him playing wideout in the NFL.<br><br>Crabtree had never played receiver.

But when a series of misfortunes silenced the voices of his star clients, he happily retired. He'd had his last innings, and with his lovely wife, Mary, was enjoying his newfound freedom.<br>So why, one morning, did he find himself headed back to the little office that he had never given up? He didn't know. But as he sat at his dusty desk, he decided to go back into business. If God had sent him there, Bart told himself, he would wait for His plan to unfold.<br>Then, at a crowded convention, he found his answer, in the person of a handsome young man named Patrick Donne, whose deep, commanding voice spoke words of profound wisdom that electrified the audience. With the thrill of discovery, Bart recognized Donne's short speech as the best inspirational talk he had ever heard. Bart was soon caught up in the extraordinary realm that was Patrick's ordinary world, where even tragedy and sorrow became transforming experiences and remarkable things happened. . . .</p><p><b>Og Mandino</b>&nbsp;is one of the most widely read inspirational and self-help authors in the world. Former president of <i>Success Unlimited</i> magazine, Mandino was the first recipient of the Napoleon Hill Gold Medal Award for literary achievement. Og Mandino was a member of the Council of Peers Award for Excellence Speaker Hall of Fame and was honored with a Master of Influence Award by the National Speakers Association. Og Mandino died in 1996, but his books continue to inspire countless thousands all over the world.You can't argue with success. Og Mandino's 16 inspirational books have sold more than 25 million copies in 20 languages. His latest follows the now-familiar formula: very earnest and very inspirational, with a tantalizing touch of the otherworld. Apparently, Og doesn't want to argue with success either. The story (most of Mandino's books wrap a flimsy fictional premise around the inspirational message) is narrated by Bart Manning, a successful agent for motivational speakers, who has been out of the business since all his best clients died off. Bart is bored so he heads to a motivational-speakers convention where he hopes to acquire a couple of new clients. Most of the participants don't measure up to Bart's high standards, but there is one, the winner of the convention's speaking contest, Patrick Donne, the Master of the Lectern, who stands out from the rest. Patrick is handsome, dynamic, and wise. He has a deep, commanding voice. And, as it turns out, he is able to heal people, though this isn't a fact Bart wants to spread around. Alas, Patrick's small plane crashes into the side of a mountain while it's ferrying him to his next speaking engagement. There's a silver lining, though, for both Patrick's and Og's fans: Patrick conveniently left behind a small book containing his accumulated wisdom--sort of the inspirational version of an airplane's black box. The book doesn't provide much new news--"Never allow anyone to rain on your parade"; "Separate yourself from the crowd"; "Look for the seed of good in every adversity." Oh well, aphorisms are always popular; that's why they're aphorisms. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Brothers: A Novel</h2><p>A bestseller in China, recently short-listed for the Man Asian Literary Prize, and a winner of France&#x2019;s Prix Courrier International, <i>Brothers</i> is an epic and wildly unhinged black comedy of modern Chinese society running amok.<br><br>Here is China as we&#x2019;ve never seen it, in a sweeping, Rabelaisian panorama of forty years of rough-and-rumble Chinese history that has already scandalized millions of readers in the author&#x2019;s homeland. Yu Hua, award-winning author of <i>To Live</i>, gives us a surreal tale of two brothers riding the dizzying roller coaster of life in a newly capitalist world. As comically mismatched teenagers, Baldy Li, a sex-obsessed ne&#x2019;er-do-well, and Song Gang, his bookish, sensitive stepbrother, vow that they will always be brothers--a bond they will struggle to maintain over the years as they weather the ups and downs of rivalry in love and making and losing millions in the new China. Their tribulations play out across a richly populated backdrop that is every bit as vibrant: the rapidly-changing village of Liu Town, full of such lively characters as the self-important Poet Zhao, the craven dentist Yanker Yu, the virginal town beauty (turned madam) Lin Hong, and the simpering vendor Popsicle Wang.<br><br>With sly and biting humor, combined with an insightful and compassionate eye for the lives of ordinary people, Yu Hua shows how the madness of the Cultural Revolution has transformed into the equally rabid madness of extreme materialism. Both tragic and absurd by turns, <i>Brothers</i> is a monumental spectacle and a fascinating vision of an extraordinary place and time.</p><p><b>Yu Hua</b> was born in 1960 in Zhejiang, China.

He has published four novels, six collections of stories, and three essays collections. His work has been translated into French, German, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, Japanese, and Korean. In 2002 Yu Hua became the first Chinese writer to win the prestigious James Joyce Foundation Award.

Yu Hua lives in Beijing.CHAPTER 1<br><br>Baldy li, our Liu Town&#x2019;s premier tycoon, had a fantastic plan of spending twenty million U.S. dollars to purchase a ride on a Russian Federation space shuttle for a tour of outer space. Perched atop his famously gold-plated toilet seat, he would close his eyes and imagine himself already floating in orbit, surrounded by the unfathomably frigid depths of space. He would look down at the glorious planet stretched out beneath him, only to choke up on realizing that he had no family left down on Earth.<br><br>Baldy Li used to have a brother named Song Gang, who was a year older and a whole head taller and with whom he shared everything. Loyal, stubborn Song Gang had died three years earlier, reduced to a pile of ashes. When Baldy Li remembered the small wooden urn containing his brother&#x2019;s remains, he had a million mixed emotions. The ashes from even a sapling, he thought, would outweigh those from Song Gang&#x2019;s bones. <br><br>Back when Baldy Li&#x2019;s mother was still alive, she always liked to speakto him about Song Gang as being a chip off the old block. She would emphasize how honest and kind he was, just like his father, and remark that father and son were like two melons from the same vine. When she talked about Baldy Li, she didn&#x2019;t say this sort of thing but would emphatically shake her head. She said that Baldy Li and his father were completely different sorts of people, on completely different paths. It was not until Baldy Li&#x2019;s fourteenth year, when he was nabbed for peeping at five women&#x2019;s bottoms in a public pit toilet, that his mother drastically reversed her earlier opinion of her son. Only then did she finally understand that Baldy Li and his father were in fact two melons from the same vine after all. Baldy Li remembered clearly how his mother had averted her eyes and turned away from him, muttering bitterly as she wiped away her tears, &#x201c;A chip off the old block.&#x201d;<br><br>Baldy Li had never met his birth father, since on the day he was born his father left this earth in a fit of stink. His mother told him that his father had drowned, but Baldy Li asked, &#x201c;How? Did he drown in the stream, in the pond, or in a well?&#x201d; His mother didn&#x2019;t respond. It was only later, after Baldy Li had been caught peeping and had become stinkingly notorious throughout Liu Town&#x2014;only then did he learn that he really was another rotten melon off the same damn vine as his father. And it was only then that he learned that his father had also been peeping at women&#x2019;s butts in a latrine when he accidentally fell into the cesspool and drowned. Everyone in Liu Town&#x2014;men and women, young and old&#x2014;laughed when they heard about Baldy Li and couldn&#x2019;t stop repeating, &#x201c;A chip off the old block.&#x201d; As sure as a tree grows leaves, if you were from Liu Town, you would have the phrase on your lips; even toddlers who had just learned to speak were gurgling it. People pointed at Baldy Li, whispering to each other and covering their mouths and snickering, but Baldy Li would maintain an innocent expression as he continued on his way. Inside, however, he would be chuckling because now&#x2014;at that time he was almost fifteen&#x2014;he finally knew what it was to be a man.<br><br>Nowadays the world is filled with women&#x2019;s bare butts shaking hither and thither, on television and in the movies, on VCRs and DVDs, i advertisements and magazines, on the sides of ballpoint pens and cigarette lighters. These include all sorts of butts: imported butts, domestic butts; white, yellow, black, and brown; big, small, fat, and thin; smooth and coarse, young and old, fake and real&#x2014;every shape and size in a bedazzling variety. Nowadays women&#x2019;s bare butts aren&#x2019;t worth much, since they can be found virtually everywhere. But back then things were different. It used to be that women&#x2019;s bottoms were considered a rare and precious commodity that you couldn&#x2019;t trade for gold or silver or pearls. To see one, you had to go peeping in the public toilet&#x2014;which is why you had a little hoodlum like Baldy Li being caught in the act, and a big hoodlum like his father losing his life for the sake of a glimpse.<br><br>Public toilets back then were different from today. Nowadays you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to spy on a woman&#x2019;s butt in a toilet even if you had a periscope, but back then there was only a flimsy partition between the men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s sections, below which there was a shared cesspool. On the other side of the partition the sounds of women peeing and shitting seemed disconcertingly close. So instead of squatting down where you should, you could poke your head under the partition, suspending yourself above the muck below by tightly gripping the boards with your hands and your legs. With the nauseating stench bringing tears to your eyes and maggots crawling all around, you could bend over like a competitive swimmer at the starting block about to dive into the pool, and the deeper you bent over, the more butt you would be able to see.<br><br>That time Baldy Li snared five butts with a single glance: a puny one, a fat one, two bony ones, and a just-right one, all lined up in a neat row, like slabs of meat in a butcher shop. The fat butt was like a fresh rump of pork, the two bony ones were like beef jerky, while the puny butt wasn&#x2019;t even worth mentioning. The butt that Baldy Li fancied was the just-right one, which lay directly in his line of sight. It was the roundest of the five, so round it seemed to curl up, with taut skin revealing the faint outlines of a tailbone. His heart pounding, he wanted to glimpse the pubic area on the other side of the tailbone, so he continued to lean down, his head burrowing deeper under the partition. But just as he was about to catch a glimpse of her pubic region, he was suddenly nabbed.<br><br>A man named Victory Zhao, one of the two Men of Talent in Liu Town, happened to enter the latrine at that very moment. He spotted someone&#x2019;s head and torso burrowing under the partition and immediately understood what was going on. He therefore grabbed Baldy Li by the scruff of his neck, plucking him up as one would a carrot. At that time Victory Zhao was in his twenties and had published a four-line poem in our provincial culture center&#x2019;s mimeographed magazine, thereby earning himself the moniker Poet Zhao. After seizing Baldy Li, Zhao flushed bright red. He dragged the fourteen-year-old outside and started lecturing him nonstop, without, however, failing to be poetic: &#x201c;So, rather than gazing at the glittering sea of sprouted greens in the fields or the fishes cavorting in the lake or the beautiful tufts of clouds in the blue sky, you choose instead to go snooping around in the toilet. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Poet Zhao went on in this vein for more than ten minutes, and yet there was still no movement from the women&#x2019;s side of the latrine. Eventually Zhao became anxious, ran to the door, and yelled for the women to come out. Forgetting that he was an elegant man of letters, he shouted rather crudely, &#x201c;Stop your pissing and shitting. You&#x2019;ve been spied upon, and you don&#x2019;t even realize it. Get your butts out here.&#x201d;<br><br>The owners of the five butts finally dashed out, shrieking and weeping. The weeper was the puny butt not worth mentioning. A little girl eleven or twelve years old, she covered her face with her hands and was crying so hard she trembled, as if Baldy Li hadn&#x2019;t peeped at her but, rather, had raped her. Baldy Li, still standing there in Poet Zhao&#x2019;s grip, watched the weeping little butt and thought, <i>What&#x2019;s all this crying over your underdeveloped little butt? I only took a look because there wasn&#x2019;t much else I could do</i>.<br><br>A pretty seventeen-year-old was the last to emerge. Blushing furiously, she took a quick look at Baldy Li and hurried away. Poet Zhao cried out for her not to leave, to come back and demand justice. Instead, she simply hurried away even faster. Baldy Li watched the swaying of her rear end as she walked, and knew that the butt so round it curled up had to be hers.<br><br>Once the round butt disappeared into the distance and the weeping little butt also left, one of the bony butts started screeching at Baldy Li,<br>spraying his face with spittle. Then she wiped her mouth and walked off as well. Baldy Li watched her walk away and noticed that her butt<br>was so flat that, now that she had her pants on, you couldn&#x2019;t even make it out.<br><br>The remaining three&#x2014;an animated Poet Zhao, a pork-rump butt, and the other jerky-flat butt&#x2014;then grabbed Baldy Li and hauled him to the police station. They marched him through the little town of less than fifty thousand, and along the way the town&#x2019;s other Man of Talent, Success Liu, joined their ranks. Like Poet Zhao, Success Liu was in his twenties and had had something published in the culture center&#x2019;s magazine. His publication was a story, its words crammed onto two pages. Compared with Zhao&#x2019;s four lines of verse, Success Liu&#x2019;s two pages were far more impressive, thereby earning him the nickname Writer Liu. Liu didn&#x2019;t lose out to Poet Zhao in terms of monikers, and he certainly couldn&#x2019;t lose out to him in other areas either. Writer Liu was on his way to buy rice when he saw Poet Zhao strutting toward him with a captive Baldy Li, and Liu immediately decided that he couldn&#x2019;t let Poet Zhao have all the glory to himself. Writer Liu hollered to Poet Zhao as he approached, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to help you!&#x201d;<br><br>Poet Zhao and Writer Liu were close writing comrades, and Writer Liu had once searched high and low for the perfect encomia for Poet<br>Zhao&#x2019;s four lines of poetry. Poet Zhao of course had responded in kind and found even more flowery praise for Writer Liu&#x2019;s two pages of text. Poet Zhao was originally walking behind Baldy Li, with the miscreant in his grip, but now that Writer Liu hustled up to them, Poet Zhao shifted to the left and offered Writer Liu the position to the right.

By the author of Moon Tiger. 40,000 first printing.</p><p><i>Making It Up</i>, Booker Prize-winning author Penelope Lively's cleverly termed "anti-memoir," is an enthralling examination of how both fate and free will can dramatically alter the lives of each and every one of us. Each of Lively's expertly crafted stories reveals the life she could have lived, had she, or another, chosen a different path. Yet in answering a series of "what if" questions, Lively does more than indulge her imagination; rather, she challenges her readers to examine the consequences of both the significant, and the seemingly trivial decisions we make every day. <p> Each of the stories in <i>Making It Up</i> deals with a different stage of Lively's life, and examines fictional alternatives to the roads she and others traveled. The Mozambique Channel charts the course of Shirley, a British nanny who accompanies her employer's family to Capetown following the German invasion of Egypt in 1942. In reality, Lively's family emigrated to Palestine; in this alternative universe, the family encounters tragedy on the open seas. The Battle of the Imjin River sends Lively's husband off to fight in the Korean War, thus changing his fate and in turn her destiny. Most compelling of all is Comet, in which the fictional Lively's untimely death is the catalyst for a half sister's second chance at love. </p><p> At the end of most narratives, Lively makes a point of reminding readers that while these stories are fictional, they are not impossible. Perhaps is this sense of endless possibility, so expertly conveyed by this talented veteran, that makes this collection so completely riveting. In the end, we are all the ones "for whom things might have spun off elsewhere, who might have become someone else." <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p><p>Penelope Lively grew up in Egypt but settled in England after the war and took a degree in history at St Anne's College, Oxford.

Clinicians and parents in these situations are confronted with complicated questions such as whether a girl can have XY chromosomes, or whether some penises are &#x201c;too small&#x201d; for a male sex assignment. Since the 1950s, standard treatment has involved determining a sex for these infants and performing surgery to normalize the infant&#x2019;s genitalia. Over the past decade intersex advocates have mounted unprecedented challenges to treatment, offering alternative perspectives about the meaning and appropriate medical response to intersexuality and driving the field of those who treat intersex conditions into a deep crisis. Katrina Karkazis offers a nuanced, compassionate picture of these charged issues in <i>Fixing Sex</i>, the first book to examine contemporary controversies over the medical management of intersexuality in the United States from the multiple perspectives of those most intimately involved. <p></p><p>Drawing extensively on interviews with adults with intersex conditions, parents, and physicians, Karkazis moves beyond the heated rhetoric to reveal the complex reality of how intersexuality is understood, treated, and experienced today. As she unravels the historical, technological, social, and political forces that have culminated in debates surrounding intersexuality, Karkazis exposes the contentious disagreements among theorists, physicians, intersex adults, activists, and parents&#x2014;and all that those debates imply about gender and the changing landscape of intersex management. She argues that by viewing intersexuality exclusively through a narrow medical lens we avoid much more difficult questions. Do gender atypical bodies require treatment? Should physicians intervene to control the &#x201c;sex&#x201d; of the body? As this illuminating book reveals, debates over treatment for intersexuality force reassessment of the seemingly natural connections between gender, biology, and the body.</p></p><p>"The cultural rules of gender are complex, and they are never more tested than in the case of intersex. <i>Fixing Sex</i> is a huge addition to the field, encompassing as it does the views of clinicians, patients, parents, and others. The topic is intrinsically interesting, but Katrina Karkazis's wonderful writing makes this a compelling story and a great read."--<b>Abraham Verghese, M.D.</b>, author of <i>The Tennis Partner</i> and Senior Associate Chair for the Theory and Practice of Medicine, Stanford University <p>"With her fascinating field data, Katrina Karkazis exposes the contentious disagreements among theoreticians, physicians, intersex adults, and parents--and all that those debates imply about the changing landscape of gender and intersex management."--<b>Suzanne J. Kessler</b>, author of <i>Lessons from the Intersexed</i> </p><p>"I couldn't put <i>Fixing Sex</i> down once I started it!

In John Perkins's eyes, plenty. The Shuar of the Amazon rainforest have lived in harmony with their surroundings for countless ages. Perkins came into contact with them while on a Peace Corps stint in the 1960s, and has sought to spread their philosophy of simplicity and balance ever since. <i>Spirit of the Shuar</i> intertwines transcribed tape recordings of Shuar voices with Perkins's experiences. Unlike anthropological accounts, such as Philippe Descola's more eloquent but detached <i>Spears of Twilight</i>, Perkins's book is conversational and enthusiastic. He teaches us about a spirituality that arises from a deep connection with nature, one in which shamans use hallucinogens to go on spiritual journeys; the spirits of nature yield hidden knowledge about plants; and dreams can always be fulfilled. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>INDIGENOUS SPIRITUALITY <br> <br>&#x201c;John Perkins has carried us effortlessly into a new encounter with an ancient world view. In the Shuar account the wisdom of the Amazonian rain forest prevails, where the spirit life teems as mercilessly and exquisitely as the biology.<em> Spirit of the Shuar</em> is filled with the poetry of authentic vision.

His interest in music and theatre led him to study at the Akademie Mozarteum in Salzburg. He wrote a quantity of poetry, several novels, short stories and plays and three volumes of autobiography. He died in 1989.The Grillparzer Prize<br><br>For the awarding of the Grillparzer Prize of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna I had to buy a suit, as I had suddenly realized two hours before the presentation that I couldn&#x2019;t appear at this doubtless extraordinary ceremony in trousers and a pullover, and so I had actually made the decision on the so-called Graben to go to the Kohlmarkt and outfit myself with appropriate formality, to which end, based on previous shopping for socks on several occasions, I picked the best-known gentleman&#x2019;s outfitters with the descriptive name Sir Anthony, if I remember correctly it was nine forty-five when I went into Sir Anthony&#x2019;s salon, the award ceremony for the Grillparzer Prize was at eleven, so I had plenty of time. I intended to buy myself the best pure-wool suit in anthracite, even if it was off the peg, with matching socks, a tie, and an Arrow shirt in fine cloth, striped gray and blue. The difficulty of initially making oneself understood in the so-called finer emporiums is well-known, even if the customer immediately says what he&#x2019;s looking for in the most concise terms, at first he&#x2019;ll be stared at incredulously until he repeats what he wants. But naturally the salesman he&#x2019;s talking to hasn&#x2019;t taken it in yet. So it took longer than it need have that time in Sir Anthony to be led to the relevant racks. In fact the arrangement of this shop was already familiar to me from buying socks there and I myself knew better than the salesman where to find the suit I was looking for. I walked over to the rack with the suits in question and pointed to one particular example, which the salesman took down from the rod to hold up for my inspection. I checked the quality of the material and even tried it on in the dressing room. I bent forward several times and leaned back and found that the trousers fit. I put on the jacket, turned around several times in front of the mirror, raised my arms and lowered them again, the jacket fit like the trousers. I walked around the shop in the suit a little bit, and took the opportunity to find the shirt and the socks. Finally I said I would keep the suit on, and I also wanted to put on the shirt and the socks. I found a tie, put it on, tightened it as much as I could, inspected myself once more in the mirror, paid, and went out. They had packed my old trousers and pullover in a bag with &#x201c;Sir Anthony&#x201d; on it, so with this bag in my hand, I crossed the Kohlmarkt to meet my aunt, with whom I was going to rendezvous in the Gerstner Restaurant on the K�rnterstrasse, up on the second floor. We wanted to eat a sandwich in order to forestall any malaise or even fainting episode during the proceedings. My aunt had already been to Gerstner&#x2019;s, she had already classified my sartorial transformation as acceptable, and uttered her famous well, all right. Until this moment I hadn&#x2019;t worn a suit for years, yes until then I had always appeared in nothing but trousers and pullover, even to the theater if I went at all, I only went in trousers and pullover, mainly in gray wool trousers and a bright red, coarse-knit sheep&#x2019;s-wool pullover that a well-disposed American had given me right after the war. In this outfit, I remember, I had traveled to Venice several times and gone to the famous theater at La Fenice, once to a production of Monteverdi&#x2019;s Tancredi directed by Vittorio Gui, and I had been with these trousers and pullover in Rome, in Palermo, in Taormina, and in Florence, and in almost all the other capitals of Europe, apart from the fact that I have almost always worn these articles of clothing at home, the shabbier the trousers and pullover, the more I loved them, for years people only saw me in these trousers and this pullover, I&#x2019;ve worn these pieces of clothing for more than a quarter of a century. Suddenly, on the Graben as I said and two hours before the awarding of the Grillparzer Prize, I found these pieces of clothing, which had grown in these decades to be a second skin, to be unsuitable for an honor connected with the name Grillparzer which would take place in the Academy of Sciences. Sitting down in the Gerstner I suddenly had the feeling the trousers were too tight for me, I thought it&#x2019;s probably the way all new trousers feel, and the jacket suddenly felt too tight and also as regards the jacket, I thought this is normal. I ordered a sandwich and drank a glass of beer with it. So who had won this so-called Grillparzer Prize before me, asked my aunt, and for the moment the only name that came to me was Gerhart Hauptmann, I&#x2019;d read that once and that was the occasion I learned of the existence of the Grillparzer Prize for the first time. The prize is not awarded regularly, only on a case-by-case basis, I said, and I thought that it was now six or seven years between awards, maybe sometimes only five, I didn&#x2019;t know exactly, I still don&#x2019;t know today. Also this awarding of the prize was naturally making me nervous and I tried to distract myself and my aunt from the fact that there was only half an hour before the ceremony began, I described the outrageousness of my deciding on the Graben to buy a suit for the ceremony and that it had been self-evident that I would find the shop on the Kohlmarkt which stocks English suits by Chester Barry and Burberry. Why, I had asked myself again, shouldn&#x2019;t I buy a top-quality suit, even if it is off the peg, and now the suit I was wearing was a suit made by Barry. My aunt again only focused on the material and was happy with the English quality. Again she said her famous well, all right. About the cut, nothing. It was classic. She was very happy about the fact that the Academy of Sciences was awarding me that Grillparzer Prize today, she said, and proud, but more happy than proud, and she got to her feet and I followed her out of the Gerstner and down onto the street. We had only a few steps to walk to the Academy of Sciences. The bag with &#x201c;Sir Anthony&#x201d; on it had become deeply repellent to me, but I couldn&#x2019;t change things. I&#x2019;ll hand over the bag before going into the Academy of Sciences, I thought. Some friends who didn&#x2019;t want to miss me being honored were also on their way, we met them in the entrance hall of the Academy. A lot of people were already gathered there and it looked as if the hall was already full. The friends left us in peace and we looked around the hall for some important person to greet us. I walked up and down the entrance hall of the Academy several times with my aunt, but nobody took even the slightest notice of us. So let&#x2019;s go in, I said, and thought, inside the hall some important person will greet me and lead me to the appropriate place with my aunt. Everything in the hall indicated tremendous festiveness and I literally had the sensation that my knees were trembling. My aunt, too, kept looking, as I did, for an important person to greet us. In vain. So we simply stood in the entrance to the hall and waited. But people were pushing past us and kept bumping into us and we had to recognize that we had chosen the least suitable place to wait. Well, is no one going to receive us? we thought. We looked around. The hall was already just about packed and all for the sole purpose of my being awarded the Grillparzer Prize of the Academy of Sciences, I thought. And no one is greeting me and my aunt. At the age of eighty-one she looked wonderful, elegant, intelligent, and in these moments she seemed to be brave as never before. Now various musicians from the Philharmonic had also taken their places at the front of the podium and everything was pointing to the beginning of the ceremony. But not one person had taken any notice of us, who were supposed to be the centerpiece. So I suddenly had an idea: we&#x2019;ll just go in, I said to my aunt, and sit in the middle of the hall where there are still a few free seats, and we&#x2019;ll wait. We went into the hall and found those free seats in the middle of the hall, many people had to stand and complained to us as we forced our way past them. So now we were sitting in the tenth or eleventh row in the middle of the hall of the Academy of Sciences and we waited. All the so-called guests of honor had now taken their places. But of course the ceremony didn&#x2019;t begin. And only I and my aunt knew why. Up front on the podium at ever-decreasing intervals excited gentlemen were running this way and that as if they were looking for something, namely me. The running this way and that by the gentlemen on the podium went on for a while, during which unrest was already breaking out in the hall. In the meantime the Minister for Sciences had arrived and taken her seat in the front row. She was greeted by the President of the Academy, whose name was Hunger, and led to her chair. A whole line of other so-called dignitaries who were unknown to me were greeted and led to the first or second row. Suddenly I saw a gentleman on the podium whisper something into the ear of another gentleman while simultaneously pointing into the tenth or eleventh row with an outstretched hand, I was the only one who knew he was pointing at me. What happened next is as follows: The gentleman who had whispered something into the ear of the other gentleman and pointed at me went down into the hall and right to my row and made his way along to me. Yes, he said, why are you sitting here when you&#x2019;re the most important person in this celebration and not up front in the first row where we, he actually said we, where we have reserved two places for you and your companion? Yes, why? he asked again and it seemed as if all eyes in the hall were on me and the gentleman. The President, said the gentleman, is asking you please to come to the front, so please come to the front, your seat is right next to the Minister, Herr Bernhard. Yes I said if it&#x2019;s that simple, but naturally I will only go into the first row if President Hunger has requested me personally to do so, it goes without saying only if President Hunger is inviting me personally to do so. My aunt said nothing during this scene and the guests of the ceremony all looked at us and the gentleman went back along the whole row and then toward the front and whispered something from beside the Minister into President Hunger&#x2019;s ear. After this there was much unrest in the hall, only the tuning-up by the players from the Philharmonic stopped it from becoming something really ugly and I saw that President Hunger was laboriously making his way toward me. Now is the time to stand firm, I thought, demonstrate my intransigence, courage, single-mindedness. I&#x2019;m not going to go and meet them, I thought, just as (in the deepest sense of the word) they didn&#x2019;t meet me. When President Hunger reached me, he said he was sorry, what he was sorry for, he didn&#x2019;t say. Please would I be kind enough to come with my aunt to the front row, my seat and my aunt&#x2019;s were between the Minister and him. So my aunt and I followed President Hunger into the front row. When we had sat down and an indefinable murmur had spread throughout the hall, the ceremony could begin. I think the men from the Philharmonic played a piece by Mozart. Then there were several longer or shorter speeches about Grillparzer. The one time I glanced over at Minister Firnberg, that was her name, she had fallen asleep, which hadn&#x2019;t escaped President Hunger either, for the Minister was snoring, even if very quietly, she was snoring, she was snoring the quiet, world-famous ministerial snore. My aunt was following the so-called ceremony with the greatest attention, when some turn of phrase in one of the speeches sounded too stupid or even too comical, she gave me a complicit glance. The two of us were having our own experience. Finally, after about an hour and a half, President Hunger stood up and went to the podium and announced the awarding of the Grillparzer Prize to me. He read out a few words of praise about my work, not without naming some titles of plays that were supposed to be by me but which I hadn&#x2019;t actually written, and listed a row of European famous names who had been singled out for the prize before me. Herr Bernhard was receiving the prize for his play A Feast for Boris, said Hunger (the play that had been appallingly badly acted a year before by the Burgtheater company in the Academy Theater), and then, as if to embrace me, he opened his arms wide. The signal for me to step onto the podium had arrived. I stood up and went to Hunger. He shook my hand and gave me a so-called award certificate of a tastelessness, like every other award certificate I have ever received, that was beyond comparison. I hadn&#x2019;t intended to say anything on the podium, I hadn&#x2019;t been asked to do so at all. So in order to choke off my embarrassment, I said a brief Thank you! and went back down into the hall and sat down. Whereupon Herr Hunger also sat down and the musicians from the Philharmonic played a piece by Beethoven. While the musicians from the Phil- harmonic were playing, I thought over the entire ceremony now ending, whose peculiarity and tastelessness and mindlessness naturally had not yet had the chance to register in my consciousness. The musicians from the Philharmonic had barely finished playing when up stood Minister Firnberg and, immediately, President Hunger and both of them went to the podium. Now everyone in the hall had stood up and was pushing toward the podium, toward the Minister naturally and President Hunger who was talking to the Minister. I stood with my aunt, dumbfounded and increasingly at a loss, and we listened to the rising hubbub of a myriad of voices. After a time the Minister looked around and asked in a voice in which inimitable arrogance competed with stupidity: So, where is the little poet? I had been standing right next to her but I didn&#x2019;t dare to make myself known. I took my aunt and we left the hall. Unhindered and without a single person having taken any notice of us, we left the Academy of Sciences at around one o&#x2019;clock. Outside, friends were waiting for us. With these friends, we went to have lunch in the place called the G�sser Bierklinik. A philosopher, an architect, their wives, and my brother. All entertaining people. I no longer remember what we ate. When I was asked during the meal how large the prize money was, it was the first time I really took in the fact that the prize had no money attached to it at all. My own humiliation then struck me as common impudence. But it&#x2019;s one of the greatest honors that can be bestowed on an Austrian, to receive the Grillparzer Prize of the Academy of Sciences, said someone at the table, I think it was the architect. It was huge, said the philosopher. My brother, as always on such occasions, said nothing. After the meal I suddenly had the feeling that the newly bought suit was far too tight and went into the shop on the Kohlmarkt, Sir Anthony I mean, and said to them in a fairly brash way but still with perfect politeness that I wished to exchange the suit, I had just bought the suit, as they knew, but it was at least one size too small. It was my firmness that made the salesman I was speaking to go straight to the rack from which my suit had come. Without objection he let me slip into the same suit but one size larger and I immediately felt that this suit fit. How could I have thought only a few hours ago that the one-size-smaller suit fit me? I clutched my head. Now I was wearing the suit that actually fit and I left the shop with the greatest sense of relief. Whoever buys the suit I have just returned, I thought, has no idea that it&#x2019;s been with me at the awarding of the Grillparzer Prize of the Academy of Sciences in Vienna. It was an absurd thought, and at this absurd thought I took heart. I spent a most enjoyable day with my aunt and we kept laughing over the people at Sir Anthony, who had let me exchange my suit without objections, although I had already worn it to the awarding of the Grillparzer Prize in the Academy of Sciences.

He hugged the dog close, noticing the way he shook and shivered with fear. "It's okay, big guy," he murmured into one of the dog's floppy ears. </p><p> The dog really was a big guy.

He is the author of more than fifty books, including <em>Is This the End?</em>, <em>The Spiritual Warfare Answer Book</em>, <em>David Jeremiah Morning and Evening Devotions</em>, and <em>Airship Genesis Kids Study Bible</em>. Dr. Jeremiah serves as the senior pastor of Shadow Mountain Community Church in San Diego, California, where he resides with his wife, Donna. They have four grown children and twelve grandchildren.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>G.K. Chesterton famously said, "The world is not lacking in wonders, but in a sense of wonder." Especially in an age of cynicism, this sense of wonder, according to Jeremiah, is at the heart of true worship. They are both, he writes, "about coming to the end of our measurements." Jeremiah, pastor of Shadow Mountain Community Church in El Cajon, Calif., and author of A Bend in the Road and The Handwriting on the Wall, joins the throng of popular pastors (Jim Cymbala, Steve Fry, etc.) writing books about "practicing the presence of God." Worship, he maintains, involves one's whole self; it's about being passionate, obedient and trusting God. These aren't new insights, and they aren't particularly deep. But they are presented here in the endearing and practiced if sometimes rambling voice of an evangelical preacher. He moves easily from theme to theme, sprinkling the material with short stories (including many old chestnuts), Scripture (sometimes engaged superficially, sometimes with more depth) and not a few handy lists of practical tips. His treatment of serious worship themes is a bit shallow: he discusses sacrifice without mentioning the Lord's Supper, and he reviews a Psalm of lament (Ps. 137) while speaking of joyful worship. The worship leader on the front lines of America's "worship wars" debating liturgical style and structure will find little help here, other than the reminder that the details of our worship are less important than the spiritual dynamics that undergird them.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Canning and Preserving</h2><p>Canning, freezing, drying.

His portrait work comprises an authoritative record of our era. His many books have set a standard for photographic publishing. As a staff photographer for <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> and later for Vogue, Avedon redefined the fashion photograph. In 1992 he became the first staff photographer in the history of <i>The New Yorker</i>.<i>Starred Review.</i> Wealthy or poor, young or old, famous or infamous, all of Avedon's subjects are photographed with the same stark, minimalist touch. This new collection spans five decades of the late photographer's work and focuses on the portraiture king's pictures of women. Beginning with a simple, joyous image of the Italian actress Anna Magnani in all her hearty, make-free glory and ending with a casual, breezy shot of mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, the loosely chronological succession of Avedon's primarily black-and-white shots demonstrates that, while the idea of photographing women is nothing new, the way the former <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> and <i>Vogue</i> contributor approached his subjects was. As explained in art historian Hollander's ending essay, Avedon was the first photographer to break down the barriers between high, "serious," photography and low, "non-serious," photography by applying his intimate, shadowy style to all of his subjects, regardless of their social background. It is a shift that can be seen in the stirring juxtapositions of toothless street performer Zazi with the model Dorian Leigh, and the full-bodied field marshal Gloria Gonzales with the petite Rose Kennedy. A treat for devotees and newcomers alike, the collection showcases both Avedon's fashion work and celebrity portraits, including such fantastic shots as a bejeweled and be-gowned Elton John in a mid-punch stance and a sexy Geoffrey Beene model posing with a skeleton. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Drawing on hundreds of interviews and scores of documents never seen before, Mayer and Abramson demonstrate that the political machinations that assured Thomas&#39;s ascension to the Court went far beyond what was revealed to the public: Several witnesses were prepared but not allowed to testify in support of Anita Hill&#39;s specific allegations about Thomas&#39;s pronounced interest in sexually explicit materials.; Republican Judiciary Committee members manipulated the FBI and misled the American public into believing that Hill was fabricating testimony during the televised hearings.</p><p>The falsehoods and distortions involved in the selling of Clarence Thomas to the American people neither started nor ended with the treatment of Anita Hill&#39;s accusations. From the beginning, the placement of Thomas on the high court was seen as a political end justifying almost any means. The full story of his confirmation thus raises questions not only about who lied and why, but, more important, about what happens when politics becomes total war and the truth--and those who tell it--are merely unfortunate sacrifices on the way to winning.Of the horde of recent books withheld from prepublication reviewers until formal release, Mayer and Abramson's expansion of their <i>New Yorker</i> article on the confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court is arguably the most eagerly anticipated. It is a largely reportorial account of the lives of Thomas and his accuser of sexual harassment, Anita Hill, up to and including the encounters that were exposed in his confirmation hearings. The book also tells of the campaign by the Bush White House to place Thomas on the Court as a sop to conservatives angered by the scuttling by liberal special-interest groups of Robert Bork's Court candidacy and the subsequent appointments of moderates Anthony Kennedy and David Souter. Its virtues are its presentation of Thomas and Hill as complex persons whose earlier experiences and attitudes help explain his denials of her charges and her long reluctance to voice those charges and its exposure of a presidential administration so determined to succeed that illegality was frequently skirted and improprieties definitely indulged. Its defects are Mayer and Abramson's unwillingness to interpret their evidence forthrightly, no documentation of far too many factual and sociological assertions (e.g., "Historically, many black men felt that black women had succeeded at their expense and so owed them special deference"), and the use of such undefined terms as <i>Far Right</i>, <i>conservative</i>, and <i>Religious Right</i> as epithets apparently assumed to connote political chicanery, hypocrisy, and bad faith. Perhaps the great begged question of the well-enough-written book is what effects their religious convictions--established but never taken seriously by Mayer and Abramson--had on how and why those two staunch Christians, Thomas and Hill, behaved as they did. Obviously not the last word on this controversial contretemps, Mayer and Abramson's effort is more credible than Brock's <i>Real Anita Hill</i> (1993), more evidentiary than Danforth's <i>Resurrection</i>. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Music Teacher from the Black Lagoon</h2><p>This popular book from the bestselling Black Lagoon series now has a brand-new cover design!MUSIC TEACHER FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is a popular book from the bestselling Black Lagoon series now reissued with a fun new cover!

Russian by birth, St. Seraphim, (c. 1759-1833) has often been compared with St. Francis of Asissi in the West, both being known largely for their unique relationships to animals and their palpable love of all people. Beyond granting us a rich telling of this man s luminous life, Fr. Lazarus Moore additionally opens the door to the eastern Christian spirituality of the Orthodox church, often still unknown in English-speaking countries. From firsthand accounts of mystical and miraculous experiences, to deep discussions of spiritual practices and theology, the very detailed account of St. Seraphim s life is a must-read for any student of spiritualilty or person of faith. Clearly, this is not a biography in the ordinary sense. Fr. Lazarus interaction with the flame of Sarov is felt on every page. It is as though he were at St. Seraphim s side, learning from his Elder s acts and words. St. Seraphim is not only set before our eyes, but is brought into our very hearts. Fr. Lazarus leads us to an invocation of the Saint himself; we feel his presence and receive a taste of that extraordinary peace, sweetness and joy for which he is known and loved by so many. The body of this book is identical to that published in 1994 by New Sarov Press (now defunct) under the title: St. Seraphim of Sarov: A Spiritual Biography; However, this present edition has an entirely new design and offers a number of new features: a foreword by Bishop Hilarion of the ROCOR diocese; original artwork; added footnotes and editorial notes; a reflection on Fr. Lazarus Moore by his caregiver at the end of his life; a history and technical notes on the manuscript; a collection of St. Seraphim&#39;s Prayer Rules given to his spiritual children; and an Akathist Hymn to St. Seraphim translated by Fr. Lazarus.</p><p>Born in Swindon, England October 18, 1902, Archimandrite Lazarus (Moore) moved to Canada when he was 18 and eventually became a Canadian citizen. There he had a personal conversion to Christianity and eventually returned to England, where he lived and served destitute people for a time. Attracted to monasticism, he then traveled, spending time on Mount Athos, the Orthodox enclave of monasteries in Greece. Desiring to become an Orthodox Christian, he went to Yugoslavia where he was tonsured a monk in the Russian-Serbian Monastery at Milkovo. He was ordained deacon and later priest in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, and was sent to serve in the Russian Mission in Palestine, overseeing 100 nuns. It is here that this manuscript was begun. In 1948 the Israeli-Arab War broke out, forcing Fr. Lazarus and the nuns to flee. He eventually went as a missionary to India and spent 20 years there, crossing paths with Mother Gavrilia, another Orthodox Christian. Later he went to Greece briefly and then lived in Australia for nearly a decade. In 1983, Father Lazarus was invited to the United States by a group of American converts to Orthodoxy who wished to learn from his vast experience and spiritual wisdom. In 1989 he moved to Alaska where he lived for 3 more years, finally dying of cancer 1992, having touched countless lives.All of us who dwell in the arid desert of these secular times and who long for refreshing spiritual drink will appreciate the 'cup' which brings us this life-giving water-namely, this very book. As well as telling the story of St. Seraphim of Sarov in a way that brings the saint powerfully before us, the book also includes an introduction to Fr. Lazarus (who himself should be the subject of such a biography), the history of the manuscript, an index, the Prayer Rules of St. Seraphim, and various prayers, including an Akathist to the saint himself. Anaphora Press has done the Church a great service in bringing this 'cup of cold water' to us thirsty souls. --Archpriest Lawrence R. Farley, St. Herman of Alaska Orthodox Church, Langley, B.C. Author of The Bible Study Companion Series<br><br>This inspirational and engaging Life of St. Seraphim of Sarov combines attention to historical accuracy with a strong emphasis on classic spirituality through the saint's advice and way of life. The practical counsels imparted in this book are appropriate not only for monastics but also those of us living in the world. St. Seraphim offers a precious reminder of one of the chief gifts of the Spirit: joy. Beautifully written and artfully presented, this book is a must-have in every Orthodox library. --Dr. Eugenia Scarvelis Constantinou, Theology and Rel. Studies, Univ. of San Diego, Searching the Scriptures podcast on Ancient Faith Radio<br><br>I am delighted to learn this biography of St Seraphim is coming back to print. This work of Father Lazarus was an important component in my own formation as an Orthodox Christian, so I hope this new edition will be met with the enthusiasm it very much deserves. --Father Patrick Henry Reardon All Saints Orthodox Church Chicago, IL; Touchstone Magazine; Author of Christ in the Psalms</p><h2>The Vikings (The Seafarers)</h2><p>Seafarers Time Life book of the sea history</p><p></p><h2>Colorado 1870-2000 Revisited</h2><p>The companion book you need to learn more about the then-and-now photographs in Colorado 1870-2000!

No one understands this better than Betty Halbreich. She's seen firsthand that putting on clothes is as much&#x2014;if not more&#x2014;about the mind as it is about the body. Each day, her dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman is filled with women searching for something. They may think they're merely shopping for a new dress, but, as Betty knows, sometimes they're really shopping for a whole new life. Whatever these women are seeking, Betty is sure to help them find it.</p><p>With simple instructions and witty asides, Betty takes her experience out of the dressing room and puts it into readers' hands. Follow her through the years and through the stores as she sheds light on such fashion conundrums as how to break up with the color black, what to wear on "Casual Fridays," what "black-tie" really means, and how to wear just about any accessory.</p><p>Betty elevates shopping and dressing to an art form, yet she makes you realize how simple it really is to look fabulous.

He received many prodigious accolades for his contributions to science, including a baronetcy in 1812, and was later made President of the Royal Society. He was, unnusually, also an accomplished poet, known throughout his life to express his feelings in verse, and his impassioned and romantic spirit was unmistakable in his vision of science. Using insightful extracts from his letters and papers, T.E. Thorpe details the life and achievements of a man who, transgressing scientific and literary circles, played a significant role in the social and intellectual world of London during this period.</p><p>Sir Thomas Edward Thorpe (1845-1925) was a chemist, physicist and historian of science. He was the principle chemist at the British Government Laboratory, and was appointed to the chair of chemistry at the Royal College of Science, London in 1885. As well as his biography of Humphry Davy, he wrote upon the history of chemistry, and his Dictionary of Applied Chemistry (1893) was a long-used standard work.</p><h2>Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents</h2><p>As Chief Official White House Photographer, Pete Souza spent more time alongside President Barack Obama than almost anyone else. His years photographing the President gave him an intimate behind-the-scenes view of the unique gravity of the Office of the Presidency, and the tremendous responsibility that comes with it. Now, as a concerned citizen observing the Trump administration, he is standing up and speaking out. SHADE is a portrait in Presidential contrasts, telling the tale of the Obama and Trump administrations through a series of visual juxtapositions. Here, more than one hundred of Souza&#39;s unforgettable images of President Obama deliver new power and meaning when framed by the tweets, news headlines, and quotes that defined the first 500 days of the Trump White House. What began with Souza&#39;s Instagram posts soon after President Trump&#39;s inauguration in January 2017 has become a potent commentary on the state of the Presidency, and the USA. Some call this &#34;throwing shade.&#34; Souza calls it telling the truth. In SHADE, Souza&#39;s photographs are more than a rejoinder to the chaos, abuses of power, and destructive policies that now define America&#39;s highest office. They are a reminder of a President we could believe in, and a courageous defense of American values.</p><p></p><h2>The American Revolutionaries: A History in Their Own Words, 1750-1800</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

He lives in New York City. <p> </p>Winner of the 2001 Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal<p></p>Grade 5 Up Once again Meltzer employs primary source material to make an era come alive. Here, he depicts the American Revolution from the point of view of its participants: its soldiers, its leaders, those who waited at home. Included are excerpts from letters, journals, reports, and official documents, all placed in context by Meltzer's concise and well written introductions which, in themselves, constitute a clear overview of American history from the 1750s to the 1780s. Through his choice of selections, Meltzer demonstrates the central point of view of the rebels, that they could not truly fulfill the promise of their immigration until they governed themselves. Included are writings from participants in the French and Indian War, Lexington and Concord, and the winter at Valley Forge; the framers of the Constitution; and so forth. Familiar names such as Washington, Adams (John and Abigail), and Franklin are includedFranklin delightfully sobut the bulk of the papers come from the common people, and these are the words that give texture to the history and make it stick in the memory: an old woman's memory of the surrendering British general at Yorktown with tears rolling down his cheeks, for example. These give a vivid sense of the struggles and brutalities of the times. Readers need to keep in mind that the purpose of this book is to give the rebel point of view. Balanced accounts exist elsewhere. This tells why one third of the colonies stood up to rebel, and it does so unforgettably.

When I'm frazzled, I firmly believe that the tray-bake is the safest way to go. Enjoy the easefulness of the oven: you just bung everything in, and you're done. I think I'd go to the supreme effort of laying on a green salad as well but, other than that, you may kick up your flamenco heels and enjoy the fiesta.<br><br><b>Serves 6</b><br>2 x 15ml tablespoons regular olive oil<br>12 chicken thighs (bone in, with skin)<br>750g chorizo sausages, whole if baby ones, or cut into 4cm chunks if regular-sized<br>1kg new potatoes, halved<br>2 red onions, peeled and roughly chopped<br>2 teaspoons dried oregano<br>grated zest 1 orange<br><br>Preheat the oven to 220�C/gas mark 7. Put the oil in the bottom of 2 shallow roasting tins, 1 tablespoon in each. Rub the skin of the chicken in the oil, then turn skin-side up, 6 pieces in each tin.<br><br>Divide the chorizo sausages and the new potatoes between the 2 tins. Sprinkle the onion and the oregano over, then grate the orange zest over the contents of the 2 tins.<br><br>Cook for 1 hour, but after 30 minutes, swap the top tray with the bottom tray in the oven and baste the contents with the orange-coloured juices.<br><br><i>Making leftovers right</i><br>chicken<br>tortillas<br><i>You can reheat what remains (removing the bones from the chicken first) within 2 days, maybe with some canned chopped tomatoes, sherry and orange juice, but my absolute favourite final destination for this dish is a quesadilla. When I was last in Kansas, that shining city of lights, I breakfasted on a chicken, pepperjack and potato quesadilla (as one does) and it inspired me. So, just get as many soft flour tortillas as your leftovers command, take the bones out of the chicken, dice the meat along with the chorizo and potatoes, and stir in some diced, shredded or grated cheese (Cheddar, mozzarella, Monterey Jack, all are possible), dollop some of the mixture into each tortilla, fold, then griddle or fry. Make sure the chicken is piping hot. This makes for a splendid hangover-banishing breakfast or near-instant supper, the sort you chow down on while watching something compellingly bad on TV.</i><br><b>Vietnamese pork noodle soup</b><br><br>I couldn't contemplate a section of speedy suppers without a noodle soup. Nothing can give succour as fast as a bowl of noodles in flavoursome broth. This is good for chowing down and for slurping and for keeping body and soul together when your stomach's empty and your day's been full.<br><br>In extremis, I am more than happy to use frozen chopped ginger and chilli, which are kept in my deep-freeze for just such an eventuality (not so infrequent).<br><br><b>Serves 2 - 4</b>, <i>depending how hungry you are</i><br><br>275g pork fillet, cut into thin discs and then fine strips<br>2 x 15ml tablespoons lime juice<br>2 x 15ml tablespoons soy sauce<br>� teaspoon paprika<br>2 x 15ml tablespoons fish sauce<br>250g ramen noodles<br>1 x 15ml tablespoon garlic oil<br>6 thin or 3 fat spring onions, finely sliced<br>1 x 15ml tablespoon chopped fresh (or frozen) ginger<br>1 litre chicken stock (good-quality cube or concentrate is fine), preferably organic<br>300g beansprouts<br>175g baby pak choi, torn into pieces<br>2 teaspoons chopped red chilli<br><br>Put the strips of pork fillet into a bowl and add the lime juice, soy sauce, paprika and fish sauce, but don't let this stand for more than 15 minutes.<br><br>Cook the noodles according to packet instructions and then refresh in cold water. Heat a wok or a deep, heavy-based frying pan, then add the garlic oil and fry the spring onions and ginger for a minute or so. Add the pork and its liquid to the wok, stirring as you go.<br><br>Cook the meat in the pan for another 2 minutes, then make up the chicken stock with boiling water, add the hot stock to the pan and bring to the boil.<br><br>Check the pork is cooked through, then add the beansprouts and baby pak choi. Add water if the soupy base has evaporated too much - about 125ml of freshly boiled water should do the trick, but you may not need it.<br><br>Arrange the drained noodles equally in 2 large or 4 small warmed bowls, ladle over them the pork and vegetables, and finally the soupy stock. Scatter the chopped chilli on top and serve.<br><b>Maple pecan bundt cake</b><br><br>This is the cake that emblematically scratches that Domestic Goddess itch: it's feelgood food (for cook and eater) by way of some simple stirring. The nutty syrupy filling is simply forked into being; you could make the cake batter with no more equipment than a bowl and a wooden spoon. But I'm afraid even my alter ego, the Domestic Goddess, is lazy, so I use an electric mixer. But beware the processor here: it's easy to overmix as you blitz, and while a dense sponge is good, a rubbery one - clearly - is not.<br><br>Not only do I love making this cake, but I get a rare feeling of calm contentment just seeing it on its stand on the kitchen surface. Then there's the eating of it, a greedy slice alongside a mid-afternoon mug of coffee, which produces nothing less than a surge of body-and-soul-bolstering joy. Now, this is what a weekend is for . . .<br><br><b>Cuts easily into 12 slices</b><br><br><i>for the maple pecan filling:</i><br>75g plain flour<br>30g soft unsalted butter<br>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>150g pecans (or walnuts), roughly chopped<br>125ml maple syrup<br><br><i>for the cake:</i><br>300g plain flour<br>1 teaspoon baking powder<br>1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda<br>125g soft unsalted butter<br>150g caster sugar<br>2 eggs<br>250ml cr�me fra�che or sour cream<br>1-2 teaspoons icing sugar, for decoration<br>flavourless oil, for greasing<br>1 x 23cm bundt tin<br><br>Preheat the oven to 180�C/gas mark 4. Using flavourless oil (or a squirt of cooking spray) grease your bundt tin, and leave upside down on newspaper for the excess oil to drain out.<br><br>Make the filling for the cake by mixing together the 75g flour and 30g butter with a fork, till you end up with the sort of mixture you'd expect when making crumble topping. Then, still using the fork, mix in the cinnamon, chopped pecans (or walnuts) and maple syrup, to form a sticky, bumpy paste. Set aside for a moment.<br><br>For the cake, measure the 300g flour, the baking powder and bicarb into a bowl.<br><br>Now, cream the butter and sugar (i.e. beat well together until light in texture and pale in colour), then beat in 1 tablespoon of the flour mixture, then 1 egg, then another tablespoonful of flour mixture followed by the second egg.<br><br>Add the rest of the flour mixture beating as you go, and then finally the cr�me fra�che or sour cream. You should expect to end up with a fairly firm cake batter.<br><br>Spoon just more than half the cake batter into the oiled bundt tin. Spread the mixture up the sides a little and around the funnel of the tin to create a rim. You don't want the sticky filling to leak out to the sides of the tin.<br><br>Dollop the maple filling carefully into the dent in the cake batter, then cover the filling with the remaining batter. Smooth the top and put the tin into the oven for 40 minutes, though it's best to check with a cake tester after 30 minutes.<br><br>Once cooked, and the cake tester comes out clean where it hits the sponge (obviously, any gooey filling will stick to the tester), let the cake cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes in its tin, then loosen the edges with a small spatula, including around the middle funnel bit, and turn the cake out onto the rack.<br><br>When the cake is cold, dust with icing sugar by pushing a teaspoonful or so through a tea strainer.<br><br><i>make ahead note</i><br>Can be baked up to 2 days ahead. Wrap tightly in clingfilm and store in airtight container. Dust with icing sugar just before serving.<br><br><i>freeze note</i><br>The cake can be frozen, tightly wrapped in double layer of clingfilm and a layer of foil, for up to 3 months. Defrost overnight at room temperature and dust with icing sugar just before serving.</p><h2>Damn Everything But The Circus</h2><p>Oversized, colorful, illustrated on every page with quotes and poetry and the artwork of Kent.</p><p></p><h2>The Twelve Powers of Man (Unity Classic Library)</h2><p>The Twelve Powers of Man, written by legendary author Charles Fillmore is widely considered to be one of the greatest classic and historical texts of all time. This great classic will surely attract a whole new generation of readers. For many, The Twelve Powers of Man is required reading for various courses and curriculums. And for others who simply enjoy reading timeless pieces of classic literature, this gem by Charles Fillmore is highly recommended. Published by Classic Books International and beautifully produced, The Twelve Powers of Man would make an ideal gift and it should be a part of everyone&#39;s personal library.</p><p>Charles Sherlock Fillmore (1854 &#x2013;1948), born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, founded Unity, a church within the New Thought movement, with his wife, Myrtle Page Fillmore, in 1889. He became known as an American mystic for his contributions to metaphysical interpretations of Biblical scripture. An ice skating accident when he was ten broke Fillmore's hip and left him with life-long disabilities. He met his future wife, Mary Caroline Page, known as Myrtle, in Denison, Texas in the mid-1870s. After losing his job there, he moved to Gunnison, Colorado where he worked at mining and real estate. He married Myrtle in Clinton, Missouri on March 29, 1881 and the newlyweds moved to Pueblo, Colorado, where Charles established a real estate business with the brother-in-law of Nona Lovell Brooks, who was later to found the Church of Divine Science. After the births of their first two sons, Lowell Page and Waldo Rickert Fillmore, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri. Two years later, in 1886, Charles and Myrtle attended New Thought classes held by Dr. E. B. Weeks. Myrtle subsequently recovered from chronic tuberculosis and attributed her recovery to her use of prayer and other methods learned in Weeks's classes. Subsequently Charles began to heal from his childhood accident, a development which he too attributed to following this philosophy. Charles Fillmore became a devoted student of philosophy and religion. In 1889, Charles left his business to focus entirely on a prayer group that would later be called 'Silent Unity'. It was named this because of a legal conflict with Mary Baker Eddy over the use of the title Christian Science. That same year he began publication of a new periodical, 'Modern Thought', notable among other things as the first publication to accept for publication the writings of the then 27-year-old New Thought pioneer William Walker Atkinson. Although Charles had no intention of making Unity into a denomination, his students wanted a more organized group. He and his wife were among the first ordained Unity ministers in 1906. Charles and Myrtle Fillmore operated the Unity organization from a campus near downtown Kansas City.</p><h2>myWorld Interactive American History Beginnings to 1877 Teacher Edition</h2><p>myWorld Interactive American History Beginnings to 1877 Teacher Edition by James West Davidson, Michael B.

It was not always a comfortable journey for Cooke: &#39;On the days I felt secure, Manhattan&#39;s maelstrom was pure energy. On shaky days, the boundlessness made me yearn for limits, or, failing that, at least a vantage point&#39;. The book that has emerged is an entertaining and integrated account of New York City&#39;s social history, architecture, physical space, and culture. Starting with the American Indian settlements and the early days when the southern-most tip of Manhattan held little more than a bleak outpost of Dutch fur traders, Cooke tracks the economic development and journeys north, from the Village&#39;s beginnings as a refuge from dreaded summer fevers to the present day Dominican enclave of Washington Heights. Written for armchair enthusiasts and walkabout adventurers, this book travels fourteen of the city&#39;s distinct and significant neighborhoods. Cooke&#39;s guide will make a historical sleuth out of local residents and tourists alike. Her off-the-beaten-path insights and witty observations help decode the urban landscape and reveal how social changes have reworked the city&#39;s terrain. Enhancing the narrative are 140 illustrations, including old engravings, maps, and current photographs. Author note: Hope Cooke is a writer and urban historian. She has lectured widely on New York history, directed the walking tours program at the Museum of the City of New York, and written a weekly column for the &#34;New York Daily News&#34;. Her essays, short stories, and reviews have appeared in such popular periodicals as &#34;Redbook&#34;, &#34;Travel and Leisure&#34;, &#34;The New York Times&#34;, and &#34;The Chicago Sun Times&#34;. Among her previously published books is her acclaimed autobiography, &#34;Time Change&#34;.</p><p>An off-the-beaten bath tour of New York that transcends the usual guide book"She really is 'Hope Cooke, the guide to New York.'

Now acclaimed author Page Stegner shows in one sweeping volume how the opening of the western frontier ignited and defined a young nation&#39;s spirit of enterprise and discovery. Winning the Wild West is an illustrated celebration of that epoch, rich in the deeds and exploits of legendary and forgotten characters, replete with hundreds of never-before-published artifacts and archival images reproduced in full color. Stories of life on the frontier fire our imaginations, but Page Stegner looks upon this epic story with an unflinching gaze, recognizing, as Larry McMurtry notes in his foreword, how severe and equivocal the struggle to &#34;win&#34; the West was. Our great land was once filled with millions of buffalo that were needlessly slaughtered, the rivers of our heartland were also mismanaged, and California, the most western state, saw the complete eradication of native tribes now lost forever. The era&#39;s pioneers were often doing little more than clinging to life*with what little strength they had left. From Lewis and Clark to the massacre at Wounded Knee, Page Stegner re-creates an engrossing, gorgeous panorama of trappers, wagon trains, cattle drives, guns, gold rushes, outlaws, lawmen, settlers, buffalo hunters, railroads, cowboy hats, and barbed wire-the hard lives of the people and the items they carried that made a new culture, a new society...a new nation.</p><p><b>Page Stegner</b> is a novelist, literary critic, and journalist. He has written extensively on the American West, including a natural history of the Grand Canyon, and has been a frequent contributor to numerous publications, including <i>Harper's, The Atlantic, Esquire, Audubon, Outside, The New York Review of Books,</i> and <i>Arizona Highways.</i> From 1967 to 1995 he was Professor of American Literature, and Director of the Creative Writing Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He lives with his wife, Lynn Stegner, and his daughter, Allison, in Shelburne, Vermont.Stegner (English, Univ. of California, Santa Cruz), a well-known essayist for periodicals like Harper's and Sierra magazine, here presents a survey of pioneer days in the 19th-century American West. The book chronologically explores various broad Old West topics in seven chapters that range from "Trappers and the Fur Trade" to "The Open Range." In addition to the main text, each chapter offers frequent breaks for a page or two on more specific sidebar subjects: for instance, the chapter on the open range offers an amusing piece called "The Hat That Won the West," accompanied by photographs of various cowboy hats and styles. Stegner's text reads easily and is richly illustrated with reproductions of well-known paintings and photographs, as well as images of common goods and of Western scenes today. The page layouts are well done, which is important with so many illustrations and quotations. If one wants to read a more scholarly, in-depth history of the American West, Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher's The American West: A New Interpretive History is a good place to start. For a well-rounded, entertaining, and educational survey, though, Stegner's book is hard to beat. Highly recommended for public libraries in particular and not a bad survey for the undergraduate either.<br><i>Charles V.

Although it existed for a mere fourteen years and boasted fewer than 1,300 students, its influence is felt throughout the world in numerous buildings, artworks, objects, concepts, and curricula.<br> <br> After the Bauhaus's closing in 1933, many of its protagonists moved to the United States, where their acceptance had to be cultivated. The key to understanding the American reception of the Bauhaus is to be found not in the �migr� success stories or the famous 1938 Bauhaus exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, but in the course of America's early contact with the Bauhaus. In this book Margret Kentgens-Craig shows that the fame of the Bauhaus in America was the result not only of the inherent qualities of its concepts and products, but also of a unique congruence of cultural supply and demand, of a consistent flow of information, and of fine-tuned marketing. Thus the history of the American reception of the Bauhaus in the 1920s and 1930s foreshadows the patterns of fame-making that became typical of the post-World War II art world. The transfer of artistic, intellectual, and pedagogical concepts from one cultural context to another is a process of transformation and integration. In presenting a case study of this process, the book also provides fresh insights into the German-American cultural history of the period from 1919 to 1936.</p><p>Margret Kentgens-Craig is the former Head of the Department of Archives and Collections at the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation, Germany.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Nineteen Eighty Four Anniversary Edition: Anniversary Eidition (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>First published in 1949, George Orwell&#39;s Nineteen Eighty-Four has lost none of the impact with which it first hit readers. Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth in London, chief city of Airstrip One. Big Brother stares out from every poster, the Thought Police uncover every act of betrayal. When Winston finds love with Julia, he discovers that life does not have to be dull and deadening, and awakens to new possibilities. Despite the police helicopters that hover and circle overhead, Winston and Julia begin to question the Party; they are drawn towards conspiracy. Yet Big Brother will not tolerate dissent - even in the mind. For those with original thoughts they invented Room 101. . .</p><p>"Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere."<p> The year is 1984; the scene is London, largest population center of Airstrip One.</p><p> Airstrip One is part of the vast political entity Oceania, which is eternally at war with one of two other vast entities, Eurasia and Eastasia. At any moment, depending upon current alignments, all existing records show either that Oceania has always been at war with Eurasia and allied with Eastasia, or that it has always been at war with Eastasia and allied with Eurasia. Winston Smith knows this, because his work at the Ministry of Truth involves the constant "correction" of such records. "'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'"</p><p> In a grim city and a terrifying country, where Big Brother is always Watching You and the Thought Police can practically read your mind, Winston is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. He knows the Party's official image of the world is a fluid fiction. He knows the Party controls the people by feeding them lies and narrowing their imaginations through a process of bewilderment and brutalization that alienates each individual from his fellows and deprives him of every liberating human pursuit from reasoned inquiry to sexual passion. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be.</p><p> <i>Newspeak</i>, <i>doublethink</i>, <i>thoughtcrime</i>--in <i>1984</i>, George Orwell created a whole vocabulary of words concerning totalitarian control that have since passed into our common vocabulary. More importantly, he has portrayed a chillingly credible dystopia. In our deeply anxious world, the seeds of unthinking conformity are everywhere in evidence; and Big Brother is always looking for his chance. <i>--Daniel Hintzsche</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Colonial Chesapeake Society (Published by the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture and the University of North Carolina Press)</h2><p>Proof that the renaissance in colonial Chesapeake studies is flourishing, this collection is the first to integrate the immigrant experience of the seventeenth century with the native-born society that characterized the Chesapeake by the eighteenth century.

Noah had waited for them to arrive for six years, three months, and twenty-one days, and it was of no consequence what time of day it was when he finally saw them. Nor did he have any doubt who they were and why they were there. They might as well have been carrying a sign.</p><p>What mattered was that life as he knew it was over.</p><p>The audience giggled a little when he checked his watch; it&#x2019;s not the kind of thing you do during a speech. It makes it look like you&#x2019;re either bored, or anxious for it to end, or both. Noah remembered that the first President Bush got in political trouble when he did it during a debate with Clinton and Perot. But Noah was now in that kind of trouble times a thousand.</p><p>He was glad he was near the end of the speech, with only about a page and a half left. It was going to be hard to concentrate on the rest, but he&#x2019;d muddle through. No sense cutting short the last speech he would ever give.</p><p>What remained of his ego also forced him to finish. While at that moment no one considered the speech in any way important, Noah knew that it would be replayed over and over on television, and would go viral within minutes. He didn&#x2019;t want to seem flustered, or panicked.</p><p>He would go down with what little was left of his dignity. He owed that much to Becky and Adam.</p><p>The four men had stopped, two on the left and two on the right, on each side of the stage. They were all dressed in dark grey suits, with apparently identical blue shirts and grey ties. They looked like a semiformal bowling team, waiting to receive their championship trophy.</p><p>&#x201c;The battlefield extends farther than the streets of Detroit, the harbor in Miami, and the border with Mexico. It extends around the world; drugs are a global epidemic and all of us are facing the scourge together.</p><p>&#x201c;Tomorrow, as most of you know, I will have the privilege of flying to Istanbul, where I will meet with representatives of fifty-one nations. I am not going there to dictate policy, to tell anyone it&#x2019;s &#x2018;our way or the highway.&#x2019; I am going there to convey our President&#x2019;s message, and I am going there to listen.&#x201d;</p><p>Noah saw no reason to change the basic text of the speech; no one would care about the words anyway. He knew full well he was no longer going to Istanbul, and within minutes the world would know that his transgressions were a lot more serious than an inaccurate speech.</p><p>&#x201c;Much in our modern world can be seen in both black and white; it seems as if everything comes with a &#x2018;plus&#x2019; and &#x2018;minus&#x2019; attached. Airplanes let us travel quickly across the planet, but the skies are much dirtier and louder for it. The Internet brings lightning-fast information, but that information is often abused and incorrect. Social networks let us connect with thousands of people, but the word &#x2018;friend&#x2019; is devalued in the process.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But the abuse of drugs offers no such choice, no inherent dichotomy. There is no upside to it, no rationalization we can make. It destroys and it debases all that it touches, with nothing positive left in its wake.&#x201d;</p><p>Noah paused and looked around the auditorium. He was at the same time sorry and glad that Becky was not there, that she was taking Adam to the nursery-school parents&#x2019; visiting day.

Never before has such a comprehensive resource been available to those searching for answers to questions on Jewish prayer. Macy Nulman has provided, in one unique, accessible volume, information on each and every prayer recited in the Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions, creating an invaluable tool for study or quick reference. Prayer books are essentially cumulative anthologies that evolved over time as new prayers were added. Study of these prayers reveals insights into the history of Judaism, providing a deeper appreciation of the heritage that has sustained the Jewish people throughout the centuries. This volume, through its encyclopedic format, makes such a study easy and enjoyable. Arranged alphabetically by prayer, the encyclopedia entries include extensive liturgical information on the prayers, their composers and development, the laws and customs surrounding them, and their place in the service. All prayers, including not only prayers recited in the synagogue, but also the Grace After Meals and the prayers to be said before going to bed, prayers for special occasions such as weddings and circumcisions, prayers for the funeral ritual and for private devotion, are featured. The entries make extensive use of cross-referencing and bibliographical information to facilitate further study. In addition, the author discusses the many poetic insertions, known as piyyutim, recited on special Sabbaths, Holy Days, and festivals. Concise and easy to consult, The Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer contains several indexes: two title indexes - one in Hebrew and one in transliteration - as well as an index of biblical verses and a name index. Additionally, a glossary defining technical terms and vocabulary associated with the prayers is provided. This important, one-of-a-kind reference volume is ideal for scholars, students, and others wh</p><p>A pioneer in Jewish liturgy and music education, <b>Macy Nulman</b> was director of the Philip and Sarah Belz School of Jewish Music at Yeshiva University and an adjunct assistant professor of music at Brooklyn College. He taught the music and liturgy of the synagogue service at the Department of Adult Education of Brooklyn College and was on the faculty of the American Theater Wing, which instituted a training program in Jewish music and liturgy for returning World War II veterans. A co-founder of the Cantorial Council of America, he has edited its Journal of Jewish Music and Liturgy since 1978. The author of numerous articles on Jewish liturgy and Jewish music education, he has written several books, including <i>The Concise Encyclopedia of Jewish Music</i>, <i>Concepts of Jewish Music and Prayer</i>, <i>Wedding Service</i>, <i>Sabbath Chants</i>, and <i>Maariv Chants</i>.This well-researched volume represents an important contribution to the study of Sephardic liturgy. At a glance one can learn about the Sephardic prayers and their <i>minhagim</i> and compare them to the Ashkenazic prayers. The reader will acquire a deeper understanding of the <i>tefillot</i>, while at the same time enriching his devotional life. (The Haham, Dr. Solomon Gaon, The World Sephardi Federation)<br><br>A debt of gratitude is owed to Macy Nulman for his invaluable contribution to the study of the Jewish prayer book. His <i>Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer</i> is an exhaustive source of enlightening and enriching knowledge. The style is lucid, the information is fascinating, and the insights are inspiring. I unequivocably recommend the volume for the probing scholar and inquisitive layperson. (Dr. Morris S. Gorelik, Rabbi, Young Israel of North Bellmore)<br><br>Readers will find Macy Nulman's <i>Encyclopedia of Jewish Prayer</i> a most welcome addition to their libraries. It is, to my mind, the richest and most easily accessible storehouse of Jewish prayers in both the Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions, and it yields its treasures in a manner both graceful and edifying. Both the layman and the scholar will find it a most valuable reference work&#x2015;and will enjoy, as well, simply browsing through the comprehensive items in this work.

Simply holding an influential position? Joseph M. Marshall III, the renowned author of the bestselling <i>The Lakota Way</i>, says <i>no</i>. Reminding us that those who hold public office are first and foremost politicians, and that corporate bigwigs serve the bottom line, Marshall presents us with a different idea of leadership, one drawn from his own Lakota Sioux culture. True leadership,&#x201d; he informs us, is only possible when character is more important than authority.&#x201d;<br>Marshall III draws inspiration from three names that have resonated powerfully throughout history to develop his unique concept of leadership: Sitting Bull, Red Cloud, and, especially Crazy Horse, whose fascinating life Marshall already chronicled in a biography that <i>Publishers Weekly</i> praised as vivid and haunting.&#x201d; Crazy Horse did not teach leadership; he simply demonstrated it, effectively and with compassion. Four factors stand out when looking at him as a leader, and they were the basis of his success:<br><i>Know yourself. Know your friends. Know the enemy. Lead the way. </i>&nbsp;<i>The Power of Four</i> shows how and why these maxims and this Native American philosophy of leadership is not only applicable to today&#x2019;s world, but desperately needed: why leadership by example is more powerful than authority; and why the selection of leaders also becomes one way of controlling those very same leaders. Marshall will open readers&#x2019; eyes and help them discover how to apply a new set of principles and actions to their own lives.<p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Joseph M. Marshall III is a historian, motivational speaker and Lakota storyteller. He is a consultant and lecturer on leadership skills and he has developed a leadership seminar program based on the philosophies of Crazy Horse. Marshall&#39;s books have been translated into seven languagesHistorian Marshall (<i>Keep Going</i>) looks to the life and accomplishments of Lakota warrior Crazy Horse for lessons on leadership in this curious and ultimately disappointing book. Best known for his 1876 defeat of General Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn, Crazy Horse was renowned for being the consummate Lakota leader: resolute in battle, courageous, magnanimous, generous to his people and conscious of the example he set. From the events of Crazy Horse's life, the author abstracts four principles of leadership: Know Yourself, Know Your Friends, Know Your Enemies and Take the Lead. While the biographical sections on Crazy Horse are tightly detailed, the personal development advice is fuzzy and unfocused. Marshall insists that anyone can and should become a leader, but his examples are almost all drawn from politics and provide few examples on how to guide families, workplaces and communities, thereby stressing the importance of choosing leaders wisely but neglecting to show readers how to grow into leadership themselves. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is a book to cherish." &#x2015;<em>Woodworking Crafts</em></strong></p> The Shaker movement in America began in 1774 when Mother Ann Lee emigrated from Manchester, England, with a small group of followers, and settled in New York State. Despite impoverished beginnings, the Shakers flourished in the early nineteenth century, and by 1840 there were four to six thousand members living in eighteen principle communities from Maine to Kentucky. Turning away from society, they lived in large families that were both celibate and communal. In striving for heaven on earth, they created a visual environment of such harmony and quiet power that it continues to impress observers today, when the Shakers have all but passed from the American scene.<br><br> The many works presented in this beautiful volume reveal the Shaker commitment to excellence in all matters.

He tells the stories of the inventor of the bentwood chair, Michael Thonet, and of the creators of the first molded-plywood chair, Charles and Ray Eames. He reveals the history of chairs to be a social history--of different ways of sitting, of changing manners and attitudes, and of varying tastes. The history of chairs is the history of who we are. We learn how the ancient Chinese switched from sitting on the floor to sitting in a chair, and how the iconic chair of Middle America--the Barcalounger--traces its roots back to the Bauhaus. Rybczynski weaves a rich tapestry that draws on art and design history, personal experience, and historical accounts. And he pairs these stories with his own delightful hand-drawn illustrations: colonial rockers and English cabrioles, languorous chaise longues, and no-nonsense ergonomic task chairs--they're all here.</p><p>The famous Danish furniture designer Hans Wegner once remarked, "A chair is only finished when someone sits in it."

In the dark early hours of D-Day, this confusion was achieved well enough, as nearly every airborne unit missed its drop zone, creating a kaleidoscope of small-unit combat. <br><br>Fortunately for the Allies, the 505th Regimental Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division hit on or near its drop zone. Its task was to seize the vital crossroads of Ste M�re Eglise, and to hold the bridge over the Merderet River at nearby La Fi�re. Benefiting from dynamic battlefield leadership, the paratroopers reached the bridge, only to be met by wave after wave of German tanks and infantry desperate to force the crossing.<br><br>Reinforced by glider troops, who suffered terribly in their landings from the now-alert Germans, the 505th not only held the vital bridge for three days but launched a counterattack in the teeth of enemy fire to secure their objective once and for all, albeit at gruesome cost.

There, on the top floor of a wood frame building sandwiched between two rambling fraternity houses, he devotes seven concentrated hours to his novel-in-progress. At 5 p.m., the 50-year-old father of two heads home for family pursuits. An evening with his wife and their two children, a dinner he enjoys cooking. Later the Lescroarts pile in the car for their children's many activities. Weekends find Lescroart entertaining friends and sometimes playing baseball, softball, golf, perhaps fishing. <p>The balanced lifestyle Lescroart resolutely maintains while directing his career as an internationally bestselling author would be the envy of the characters in his compelling novels--novels such as <i>A Certain Justice</i>, <i>The 13th Juror</i>, and <i>The Mercy Rule</i>. For while Lescroart delivers page-turning suspenseful action that has drawn starred reviews from <i>Publishers Weekly</i> and praise from Larry King, <i>People magazine</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and many others, what distinguishes the author's engrossing reads is something more difficult to create. That something is a study of characters under pressure, characters who haven't achieved the balance John maintains in his life. They are characters whose value systems find them fighting an ongoing battle between demands of the job as they seek justice in the courtroom and in the station house and the insistent needs of their families. </p><p>And, as in his gourmet cooking, Lescroart adds the seasoning that makes his stories so memorable that once readers get a taste, they acquire an appetite for all his books. That seasoning is the thought-provoking backdrop of front page issues such as domestic violence, racial conflict and assisted suicide. But don't expect a difficult read in a John Lescroart book. He has an easy-going style, with a talent for pacing and crisp dialogue. </p><p>John has won the prestigious Joseph Henry Jackson Award for Best Novel by a California author for his first book, <i>Sunburn</i>; a Shamus Award nomination for Best Novel for <i>Dead Irish</i>, and an Anthony Award Nomination for Best Novel for <i>The 13th Juror</i>. Most recently, his short story "The Adventure of the Giant Rat of Sumatra" was chosen as one of Houghton-Mifflin's Twenty Best Mystery Short Stories of 1997. </p><p>An entertaining, humorous speaker with as much to say at the microphone as on the printed page, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author can occasionally be persuaded to leave his northern California digs for such engagements.</p></p><h2>Naruto Anime Profiles, Vol. 1: Episodes 1-37</h2><p>Anime episodes #1-37 fully covered!

The brambles tore at her skin and left trickles of blood where they touched. Davy was calling for her, crying out for her to find him. Perspiration matted her hair to her forehead, and she pressed on through the thorns. She had to find him. He was depending on her.<br> <br> They said he was dead, but she knew it wasn't so. He was out here somewhere. Samson barked, an urgent sound that propelled her past the thicket. A cabin lay in the valley before her. He was down there. Her son was waiting for her. Samson barked again and rushed forward.<br> <br> Bree Nicholls awoke with a start. She forced herself to take deep breaths. In and out, in and out. She and Samson had found Davy in a cabin very much like the one in her dream. He was just fine. But the terror of the nightmare didn't leave her. Had Samson really barked? Maybe something was wrong.<br> <br> She slipped out of bed and tiptoed down the hallway to her son's bedroom. Moonlight filtered through the Superman curtains at his window. Her bare feet whispered across the smooth oak floor until she reached the bed. She touched a small hump in the covers, and her hand sank to the mattress. She gasped, and her hands roamed the tousled blankets and sheets.<br> <br> She stepped to the wall and flicked on the light. "Davy?" <br> <br> The doctor had said to make sure she didn't startle him when he was having one of his night terrors. She went to the closet and looked on the floor. Only a jumble of baseballs, his father's mitt, and some Playmobil pirates lay on the floor. She looked under the bed. Not there. Panic rose in her chest in a rush of cold dread. <br> <br> She ran to the door and called for her dog as she rushed down the hallway. "Samson!" The dog could lead her to her boy. At the top of the stairs, she touched the light switch and a welcome brightness lit the way. <br> <br> She reached the bottom of the steps. "Samson, come!"<br> <br> She heard the click of his nails on the hardwood floor of the entry. He came through the door into the living room, his tail down, a sure sign of distress. He pressed his cold nose against her leg, bare below her knee-length nightgown. <br> <br> Bree rubbed his ears. "Where's Davy, boy? Find Davy."<br> <br> The dog whined and padded down the entry hall toward the back of the house. Four years old now, he had the stamina of a German shepherd mixed with the heart of the true mutt he was. She followed him. He pushed through the swinging door to the kitchen. A musty scent wafted up from the open basement door. Surely Davy wasn't down there. What if he'd fallen? Frantic now, Bree flipped on the basement light, grabbed the flashlight on a shelf at the top of the landing, and rushed past Samson down the stairs.<br> <br> There was no sign of Davy at the foot of the stairs, and she felt the tension in her shoulders ease a bit. At least he hadn't fallen. "Davy?" she called, still careful to keep her voice soft and as unconcerned as she was able. <br> <br> A whimper answered her, but in the cavernous shadows of the basement, she couldn't tell where it came from. Samson pushed past her and padded toward a shadowy recess. The dog lay on his paws and stared under a bulky table laden with Rob's tools. He looked back toward Bree as if to ask what was taking her so long.<br> <br> She went to the table and dropped to her knees. "Davy, I'm here. It's okay. You're safe." <br> <br> The flashlight's beam revealed her son's small form. Wedged under the table in a small hole where the concrete had broken away from the wall, Davy lay curled in a fetal position, his thumb in his mouth. his favorite book, The Tale of Three Trees by Angela Hunt, was clutched against his chest. Right now he looked even younger than his four years. Bree reached out and touched his face. "Hey, pumpkin, found you. You ready to quit playing hide-and-seek and get back to bed?" It was all she could do to keep her voice light.<br> <br> Davy blinked slowly and pulled his hand away from his mouth. "Mommy," he said. "I'm thirsty."<br> <br> "Well, come on out from there and I'll get you a drink of juice." She shoved the table out of the way then scooped him into her arms and held him tightly. She could feel his heart beating as rapidly as hers. <br> <br> He buried his face against her neck. "I was trying to find you, Mommy. But she wouldn't let me go." <br> <br> Davy never called the woman who found him after the plane crash by her real name, Rachel. It was always "her" or "she." Bree stroked his damp hair. "You're safe now, pumpkin." <br> <br> The doctor said it was very important not to let him know how his night wanderings upset her. They more than upset her. They took her back to the terrible year she and Samson had spent searching for the plane wreckage and his body.<br> <br> Instead, a wonderful miracle had awaited her, but the trauma of separation had scarred them both. She clutched her son more tightly until he stirred restlessly. "Let's get you upstairs," she said with a cheeriness she didn't feel.<br> <br> She snapped her fingers at Samson, but the dog was busy scratching at the hole Davy had burrowed into. "Come on, Samson. It's late."<br> <br> She started toward the steps, but still the dog didn't follow. Frowning, she watched Samson. As one of the best search-and-rescue dogs in the country, he could find a flea in a haystack. Right now he was acting as if he was on a mission. He whined and scratched at the wall again. <br> <br> Bree flicked on the flashlight and shone it on the open hole. The beam revealed a bigger space than she had originally perceived. What was back there that had Samson so upset? He growled and dug tenaciously. <br> <br> The flashlight's beam flickered, and she turned it off. "Come on, Samson. We'll see what's back there tomorrow." Still holding Davy in one arm, she reached down and tugged at the dog's collar. He ceased digging reluctantly, then followed her up the stairs. She made a mental note to call Kade tomorrow and have him help her take a look. <br> <br> ~~~<br> <br> Julia Child's gravelly voice was enough to compete with fingernails on a chalkboard, but Bree didn't notice, so intent was she on the woman's instructions. His night terror of just hours before forgotten, Davy sat on the bar stool, his thin legs swinging and his gaze on his mother as she watched Julia on a small kitchen tele-vision mounted under the cabinets. Floury hand prints marked Bree's jeans, but she would change into a clean pair of slacks before dinner. <br> <br> Samson lay on the floor in a patch of sunshine streaming through the kitchen window. The Snow King had tightened his grip on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Outside the Nichollses' lighthouse home, thick floes of ice floated in Lake Superior like great white whales stretching in the morning sun. Spring's gentle touch would wrest the U.P. from winter's clutches in a few more weeks.<br> <br> Bree kept stealing glances outside as she worked. She loved Rock Harbor, Michigan. Small but quaint, it perched along Lake Superior with the water to its west and massive stretches of North Woods surrounding the rest of the small town. Good people lived here, many from Finnish stock, hardy and sometimes painfully honest. She couldn't imagine living anywhere else now.<br> <br> Her tongue poking the side of her mouth, Bree measured the cinnamon and dumped it in the bowl with the apples. She would turn out a great pie if it killed her. Her mother-in-law, Anu, had told her not to bother, that she could make the pies for Easter. But with the store's twentieth anniversary bash going on, Bree didn't want Anu to have to do it all. Besides, now that Davy was home, Bree needed to learn to cook better. It was fine for her to live on peanut-butter sandwiches and canned soup, but it wasn't good enough for her son. She'd been working on her culinary skills for several months now, but cooking wasn't something that came naturally. <br> <br> She took a moment to glance at her son. He'd only been home a little over three months, and she still didn't get enough of looking at him. His heart-shaped face was a miniature version of Bree's own, though his nose was his father's, as were his ears. The best of them both, Rob had always said. The thought of her late husband was both a pain and a pleasure. But slowly she was getting on with her life. At least that's what she told herself.<br> <br> "Can I have some 'stachios?" Davy asked.<br> <br> He coughed, a hacking sound that brought a frown to her face. "You doing okay?" she asked, wiping her hands on her jeans again. <br> <br> He sneezed. "My tummy feels funny."<br> <br> Was he getting sick? Last night's excursion to the basement might have given him more than bleary morning eyes. She put down the wooden spoon and went to him, putting her hand on his forehead. It was cool and dry. He sneezed again. "Are you getting a cold?" she asked anxiously.<br> <br> "I want to eat."<br> <br> Surely that meant he was fine. But she wouldn't take any chances. She reached for the phone and dialed Dr. Parker. He promised to come by, and she hung up feeling guilty. She hated to take advantage of an old family friend, but Davy was still weak from his ordeal, and she wanted to make sure he got well as quickly as possible.<br> <br> She pulled the bag of pistachios to her and dug out a handful for him. "You want me to help you open them?"<br> <br> "I can do it." He worked his mouth as he struggled with the nut then smiled in triumph as he succeeded in cracking it. <br> <br> She turned back to her pie. Maybe she could get it in the oven before the doctor got here. Julia was droning on about aluminum foil on the edges of the crust, but Bree didn't have any foil. She listened with half an ear and finished the pie, then flipped the channel to the Cartoon Network for Davy.<br> <br> The doorbell rang just as she slid th...</p></p><h2>LA Senora Frisby Y Las Ratas De Nimh/Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh (Coleccion El Barco De Vapor, 82) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>An inquisitive mouse becomes involved in an intrigue when she discovers her late husband had been held captive at a bizarre laboratory.</p><p></p><h2>Best Practice for Youth Sport</h2><p><p> Although the physical and psychological benefits of youth participating in sport are evident, the increasing professionalization and specialization of youth sport, primarily by coaches and parents, are changing the culture of youth sport and causing it to erode the ideal mantra: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all about the kids.&#x201d; </p><p> In<i> Best Practice for Youth Sport</i>, readers will gain an appreciation of an array of issues regarding youth sport. This research-based text is presented in a practical manner, with examples from current events that foster readers&#x2019; interest and class discussion. The content is based on the principle of developmentally appropriate practice (DAP), which can be defined as engaging in decisions, behaviors, and policies that meet the physical, psychological, and social needs of children and youth based on their ages and maturational levels. This groundbreaking resource covers a breadth of topics, including bone development, burnout, gender and racial stereotypes, injuries, motor behavior, and parental pressures. </p><p> Written by Robin S. Vealey and Melissa A. Chase, the 16 chapters of <i>Best Practice for Youth Sport</i> are divided into four parts. Part I, Youth Sport Basics, provides readers with the fundamental knowledge and background related to the history, evolution, and organization of youth sport. Part II, Maturation and Readiness for Youth Sport Participants, is the core of understanding how and why youth sport is different from adult sport. This part details why it is important to know when youth are ready to learn and compete. Part III, Intensity of Participation in Youth Sport, examines the appropriateness of physical and psychological intensity at various developmental stages and the potential ramifications of overtraining, overspecialization, overstress, and overuse. The text concludes with part IV, Social Considerations in Youth Sport, which examines how youth sport coaches and parents can help create a supportive social environment so that children can maximize the enjoyment and benefits from youth sport. </p><p> In addition to 14 appendixes, activities, glossaries, study questions, and other resources that appear in <i>Best Practice for Youth Sport</i>, the textbook is enhanced with instructor ancillaries: a test package, image bank, and instructor guide that features a syllabus, additional study questions and learning activities, tips on teaching difficult concepts, and additional readings and resources. These specialized resources ensure that instructors will be ready for each class session with engaging materials. </p><p><i>Best Practice for Youth Sport</i> provides readers with knowledge of sport science concerning youth sport and engages them through the use of anecdotes, activities, case studies, and practical strategies. Armed with the knowledge from this text, students, coaches, parents, administrators, and others will be able to become active agents of social change in structuring and enhancing youth sport programs to meet the unique developmental needs of children, making the programs athlete centered rather than adult centered so that they truly are all about the kids. </p></p><p><p><b>Robin S.

A host of commemorative events are planned for the centenary, and with many Titanic books set to hit the market, the question arises as to how this one will stand out from the others. Gilded Lives, Fatal Voyage is a fresh take on this everpopular subject through the prism of the lives of the Titanic&#39;s first class passengers - woven into a gripping account of the ship&#39;s short life. The ship has often been called a microcosm of the Edwardian era - this has never been more true than it is presented in this book. In other accounts of the Titanic the ship is the protagonist and those on board merely bit part players. Here, its leading characters are moved into the foreground and their stories intertwined with the powerful narrative arc of the doomed voyage. The book probes into the lives of those on board in a way that no other account has done. Here we find some of Britain&#39;s and America&#39;s leading society figures engaged in illicit homosexual relationships, flaunting extra-marital affairs and openly risking scandal in the ballrooms of the world&#39;s most famous ship, oblivious of the disaster that lay in the seas ahead.</p><p>Hugh Brewster has had twenty-five years of experience with the story of the Titanic and has edited, compiled or written fifteen books about the great liner.&#34;[A]n impressive amount of information, often directly pulling from firsthand accounts.

He is a director of The Ian Fleming Foundation. Benson lives and works in the Chicago area.The fate of the world, and James Bond, are in capable hands in this second 007 adventure from Benson (Zero Minus Ten, 1997). Writing as both a disciple and defender of Western civilization's most enduring action hero, Benson, a director of the Ian Fleming Foundation and author of the fan bible, the James Bond Bedside Companion, attempts to meld Fleming's brooding, coolly cruel British knight with the dapper, quip-slinging techno-warrior of the Bond movies, with a few respectful bows to the superhuman stuntman Bond became when British thriller-factory John Gardner had an exclusive franchise on the series. All the canonical elements are in place--the Flemingesque fetish for brand names (were informed that Bond's crippled American sidekick, former CIA agent Felix Leiter, now zooms about in a high-speed Action Arrow motorized wheelchair), a demented, megalomaniacal father figure villain (Konstantine Romanos, an independently wealthy mathematics professor who thinks he's the reincarnation of Pythagoras), the ultimate car (a self-driving Jaguar XK8 with more gadgets than the Batmobile but, alas, no ejection seat), the corny sex jokes (Bond seduces the statuesque female director of a sperm bank who extracts her sample from 007 as passionately as possible), a superbly furnished techno-fortress with a hidden superweapon, and, most infamously, a harem of beautiful, accomplished women, some of whom are bisexual, all of whom cant resist Bond's darkly handsome charms. The plot, meanwhile, is standard Bond, with Romanos using designer weaponry to kill numerous innocent people, with a purloined Pershing missile being readied for launch. Between the requisite scenes of sex, violence, and destruction, Benson's Bond occasionally succumbs to existential gloom, but never fails to do the right thing for Queen and country. A postmodern treat for fans and newcomers that lovingly, if not ironically, duplicates a formula so familiar that originality would be sacrilege.

The wealth of diagrams augments the text and gives you a visual aid as well. <p>The first two books, <i>Excelling at Dog Agility Book 1: Obstacle Training and Excelling at Dog Agility Book 2: Sequence Training</i> lay the ground work for the third by providing theory and essential foundation skills. <i>Book 3</i> shows you how to isolate and train the skills necessary to compete successfully at advanced levels of competition by giving you enormous flexibility in handling strategies and therefore, a competitive edge. In addition there is new material that that can be used at the begining levels. The chapter on training aids is one example.</p><p> Each chapter include topics such as "How to Begin", "If You Have Problems", "Using Training Aids", How to Progress", "Games", "Praise", "Proofing" and "Training Tips". A chapter on weave pole skills reminds us that they must be honed and maintained throughout your dog's agility career. Ms. Simmons-Moake describes and illustrates progressive exercises to accomplish this task. The chapter on the pause table shows you how to teach your dog to jump on the table, keep from sliding off, and get the quick, solid sit or down so necessary to save time. Other chapters cover exciting techniques and skills. The "send-and-run" technique allows you to move ahead before your dog has committed to an obstacle. The dog confidently follows your direction regardless of what you do afterward. "Layering", the technique of keeping one or more obstacles between you and your dog, allows you to complete sequences smoothly without pulling your dog off course. Teaching your dog to discriminate obstacles with verbal cues can mean the difference between qualifying or not. It is best to begin training this skill by calling your dog to you over an obstacle rather than sending until the dog gains confidence. Other useful verbal directions are the "get-out" and the "heel and side" commands that allow you to adjust your dog's path through the course. "Back chaining" is a skill that can be used to gain distance from your dog on the course. Sequences that are often found in advanced competition, such as "pinwheels", "zig-zags" and gamble with its variations are thoroughly addressed with text and diagrams. A chapter on practicing at home illustrates how, with few obstacles in your inventory, you can hone your competitive skills. Appendix A: Problem Solving is done in a question and answer format with many possible solutions given to a particular problem. Appendix B: Video Topic Guide - Tape 3 coordinates the book's text with specific times on tape 3 of her award winning video series <i>Competitive Agility Training</i>. For those who learn better visually, the combination of the books' diagrams and videos are an unparallelled means to become a more accomplished agility competitor. For those of us who are becoming a bit creaky with age, the techniques and skills presented can help us to continue to show our Belgians in agility without having to try and keep up with this very intelligent and speedy breed.

In their account, the complex hierarchy of the cartel directs an international operation that resembles and surpasses many multinational corporations in efficiency and sophisticated marketing techniques. Run by a small group of murderous young overlords, the organization has thousands of employees--from peasants and pilots to lawyers and hit-men. Initially, corrupt bank and government officials in Colombia favored the cartel's growth. However, this changed after the cartel's successful opposition to an extradition treaty between Colombia and the U.S., which involved a reign of terror against Colombian institutions. The extended activities of the cocaine barons in Central America have compromised U.S. national interests, the authors maintain, especially in the case of reported contra- cartel links and alleged drug trafficking by Panama's Noriega. Despite concerted law enforcement efforts, the cartel still thrives.

We are still waiting to find out who won. The Indy 500 was created to showcase the controversial new sport of automobile racing, which was sweeping the country. Daring young men risked life and limb by driving automobiles at the astonishing speed of 75 miles per hour with no seat belts, hard helmets, or roll bars. When the Indianapolis Speedway opened in 1909, seven people were killed, some of them spectators. Oil-slicked surfaces, clouds of smoke, exploding tires, and flying grit all made driving extremely hazardous, especially with the open-cockpit, windshield-less vehicles. Most drivers rode with a mechanic, who pumped oil manually while watching out for cars attempting to pass, and drivers would sometimes throw wrenches or bolts at each other during the race. The night before an event the racers would take up a collection for the next day?s new widows.

A native of the Bronx, he now lives in Brooklyn with his wife, the writer Sarah Saffian.<p> <b> <b>1</b> </b> </p><p><b>UNTIL THE MOMENT</b> that one ran over his breastbone, Clifford Littrell had been exceedingly fond of automobiles. To be sure, a lot of young people were car-crazy in 1909, endlessly debating the relative merits of the National, the Pierce-Arrow, and the Knox, fogging the windows at the McFarlan showroom with their Sweet Caporal&#x2013;scented sighs, scanning the glossy pages of <i>The Horseless Age</i> for gossip about rumored innovations like windshields and black tires (as opposed to the standard, tiresome off-white)&#x2014;and digging through bins at dry goods emporiums for the latest in silk driving scarves (for men) or the kind of cunning little riding bonnet sported by Lottie Lakeside in the hit Broadway musical <i>The Motor Girl.</i> But Littrell was no mere enthusiast. </p><p>No, this poor fellow&#x2014;whom we come upon writhing in the bustling intersection of Capitol Avenue and Vermont Street in Indianapolis, Indiana, at 11:30 on the sunny, sticky morning of Tuesday, August 17&#x2014;had dedicated his life to what was then known as autoism. At the age of twenty-seven, he had risen from the position of molder in a metal factory to what was then known as a mechanician. His main job was to road-test motorcycles, which is what some Americans who disdained the French word <i>automobile</i> (because it was French) then called cars. It was still so early in the motor age, you see&#x2014;three years before the Stutz Bearcat and four before the Duesenberg&#x2014;that people hadn&#x2019;t quite worked out the terminology. </p><p>A corpse was a corpse, though, and the prospect of seeing one caused a crowd to gather. Littrell was no one they knew, they could see, yet no mysterious stranger, either, having just come loose from the noisy caravan of men and equipment heading to the not-quite-finished Indianapolis Motor Parkway&#x2014;or rather <i>Speedway</i>, as they had been calling it these last couple of months&#x2014;some five miles northwest of town. A long line of Jacksons, Marmons, Amplexes, Buicks, and other cars had been traveling there, circus-train-style, the better to attract attention and whip up curiosity as they prepared for a historic event: the first racing meet in America conducted on a track built specifically for automobiles. Thousands of auto industry people&#x2014;executives, salesmen, and common laborers like Littrell&#x2014;had flocked to Indianapolis that week for three days of competition that would begin the next afternoon and culminate in the first edition of the 300-mile Wheeler-Schebler race on Saturday, August 21. </p><p>Littrell worked for Stoddard-Dayton of Dayton, Ohio, one of more than a thousand auto manufacturers then trying to grab a share of the booming U.S. market. Most of those car companies were tiny operations&#x2014;some were virtual one-man shops&#x2014;but Stoddard-Dayton ranked among the largest, with several hundred employees. Littrell had started there about five years before, when the company, instead of turning out &#x201c;Touring cars with Speed and Symmetry in every line,&#x201d; as their literature boasted, was instead still making mowers, hay rakes, and harrows. That morning he had been perched on the rear of the company&#x2019;s highly touted No. 19 race car as it rolled out of the garage. It was a precarious spot, atop the gas tank with no handle to grasp, but the trip to the Speedway seemed relatively short, and the traffic, a mix of horse-drawn and motorized vehicles, was moving sluggishly; he thought he would be all right. Then he remembered a wrench he had left behind, and, without informing the driver, he braced himself to hop off the vehicle, figuring he would grab the tool, catch up to the car, and quickly clamber back aboard. Just at that moment, though, the traffic jam eased a bit, the No. 19 car surged forward, and Littrell, who had been poised to jump, tumbled to the street, landing on his back. Brakes, like automobile lingo, were a work in progress in those early months of the Taft administration, and the car behind him could not stop in time to avert disaster. One witness said the sound was &#x201c;that of a coconut being cleaved.&#x201d; </p><p>The ambulance that came for Littrell was a brand-new electric-powered Waverly with a butter-soft black leather driver&#x2019;s seat and an interior of polished poplar, the kind of elegant, expensive ($3,000) vehicle already becoming increasingly rare following the introduction of the plebeian Model T Ford ($850) in 1908. Befitting a city that aspired to open a clear lead over Detroit as an automobile manufacturing center, Indianapolis had two motorized ambulances in those days, proudly publicized in the press. That the unknown Samaritan who called for help that morning had summoned the one from the Methodist Hospital, and not the motor ambulance belonging to the Flanner and Buchanan funeral home, is perhaps a testament to the optimism that percolated through the town of 233,000 on the eve of the Speedway&#x2019;s debut. Or maybe it was just wishful thinking. Once the word spread about Littrell&#x2019;s accident, his well-being would concern a circle far beyond his immediate family, back in their humble digs on Dayton&#x2019;s Wyoming Street. Some of the most powerful men in Indianapolis would stop what they were doing and pray that the Lord not take the beloved husband of Jesse and the devoted father of two-year-old Helen&#x2014;at least not until Sunday, by which time the crowds and the out-of-town newspapermen would have moved on. </p><p>One couldn&#x2019;t blame the town fathers and the Speedway founders for hoping to avoid unseemly incidents that might mar the mood. A lot was at stake for the spunky Circle City over the next few days, and to have a young autoist mangled by one of the very machines that everyone had come to celebrate would be something sure to get tongues a-clucking. If the papers played it as a random accident that was one thing; plenty of car wrecks made the pages of the town&#x2019;s four dailies each day, usually with too much information about heads sliced cleanly open and knees crushed to a papery translucence. But should the Littrell incident turn into some sentimental tabloid trope about how &#x201c;Death had visited the race meeting even before the first cars were cranked up for competition&#x201d; and so on, as it easily might&#x2014;well, that no doubt would set off the biggest round of I-told-you-so&#x2019;s since the day in 1897 when the first automobile arrived in Indianapolis (it was a Benz, shipped from Germany) and, against much good advice, carriage maker Charles Black took it for a trial spin and promptly smashed a horse cart parked outside the Grand Hotel and two plate glass shopwindows on Washington Street. More than that, Littrell&#x2019;s death, should it occur, would provide political leverage to certain voices in the community who equated an auto racing track with the Seventh Circle of Hell, and wanted no such diabolical venue in Indianapolis. </p><p><b>WHILE SCIENTIFIC MARKET</b> research was still in its infancy, it was clear from tavern-talk and newspaper stories that America was sharply divided on the subject of automobile racing. To put that controversy in context, let&#x2019;s recall first, though, that the nation just then was palpitating through the first torrid stages of a love affair with organized sports. Entrepreneurs and politicians had established that horse racing, boxing, and baseball&#x2014;the three most popular pastimes in the first decade of the twentieth century&#x2014;could, if presented properly, stir civic pride, keep young men out of trouble, and enliven the local economy. The relatively new games of football and basketball were meanwhile coming on strong as school sports. Indiana, for its part, already had thriving men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s basketball leagues that mixed college and YMCA (and YWCA) teams, and a baseball club, the Indianapolis Indians, who in 1909 were the reigning champs of the American Association, eclipsing their cross-state rivals, the Muncie Fruit Jars. But Indianapolis&#x2014;twenty-third on the list of American cities in terms of economic clout, and hell-bent on cracking the top ten&#x2014;badly needed what today would be called a marquee event to attract out-of-towners and help the city overcome its image as a burg somehow both sleazy and dull. </p><p>Earlier that year, Mayor Charles A. Bookwalter, borrowing from the writings of Saint Paul, had ordered the proud phrase &#x201c;I am a citizen of no mean city&#x201d; inscribed on the cornerstone of the new city hall. Bookwalter, a practical politician known for his tolerance of downtown gin mills, whorehouses, and gambling dens, was also a strong believer in sports as a tool of urban advancement; a former president of the American Bowling Congress, Bookwalter had brought the titans of tenpins to Indianapolis for the ABC Tournament in 1903, and the event had attracted a fair-sized &#x201c;family&#x201d; audience to Tomlinson Hall. For those looking to burnish the city&#x2019;s reputation as a place where Big Things happened, and crowds flocked, sports was obviously one way to go. But was an <i>automobile speedway</i> really the project around which the good citizens of Indianapolis wanted to rally? </p><p>Was auto racing, for that matter, really even a <i>sport</i>? </p><p>It was a fair question. </p><p>A large problem with auto racing for many people (then and now) was that machines, not athletes, provided the muscle and the quickness. A short stroll through the pit area at, say, the one-mile Indiana State Fairgrounds track, where car races in Indianapolis had previously occurred, could have told you that most professional autoists were not athletes in the conventional sense of the term. A star driver like Ralph DePalma believed in calisthenics, a balanced diet, and abstaining from alcohol while preparing for a race (he sometimes consumed nothing but bread and milk for several days before a competition), but DePalma was a singular driver in any number of ways. In terms of personal habits and physical presence, the cherubic, cigar-chomping Barney Oldfield and the ungainly, pear-shaped Louis Chevrolet were more the norm for...</p></p><h2>Jump Into Science: Sun</h2><p>How hot is the sun?

She wants another mystery.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>After leaving Miss Brown, Trixie hurried across the living-room and outside to the path that led around and down to the cabins. With the exception of two which were called &#x201c;family size,&#x201d; all of the cabins on her list were tiny cottages and she tidied them very quickly. The larger ones took longer but at last she was through and started off around the pool toward the kitchen.<br>As she approached Maria&#x2019;s small cabin she noticed that a little boy was playing out in front of it and guessed he must be Pedro, called Petey.<br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; she greeted him, suddenly feeling homesick for Bobby. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a little brother who is just about the same age as you.&#x201d;<br>The dark-haired boy stared at her solemnly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the first grade but I didn&#x2019;t go to school today &#x2019;cause I got sort of a sniffle.&#x201d; He sniffed. &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t the cold kind of sniffle but Mommy is too dumb to know that. Does your brother ever get the crying kind of sniffle and get kept home from school on account of it?&#x201d;<br>Trixie thought for a minute. &#x201c;Bobby doesn&#x2019;t cry very much. Why have you been crying, Petey?&#x201d;<br>He doubled up his grimy fists. &#x201c;On account of my mommy is an ole meany. She wouldn&#x2019;t let me go wif Granddaddy and all of &#x2019;em. So I&#x2019;m gonna run away to where Granddaddy is. I&#x2019;m not scared of that great big ole monkey.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What monkey?&#x201d; Trixie asked curiously.<br>He pursed his lips. &#x201c;Guess maybe you&#x2019;d call him a g&#x2019;rilla, he&#x2019;s that big. I&#x2019;m not talking about the little ones that sort of hop and dance around you. I&#x2019;m talking about the great big &#x2019;normous one that&#x2019;s way up high, you know, all ready to jump down on you and eat you all up.&#x201d;<br>It was Trixie&#x2019;s turn to stare. &#x201c;What are you talking about? Did your granddaddy go someplace where there are lots of monkeys? A zoo, maybe?&#x201d;<br>He shook his head. &#x201c;Zoo! It&#x2019;s sort of a cavelike place. But I&#x2019;m not scared of that great big ole ape! I&#x2019;m going to give him a great big swat just the way I did last year and then I&#x2019;m going to eat <i>him</i> all up.&#x201d;<br>Trixie frowned, torn between curiosity and the voice of her conscience which told her that she shouldn&#x2019;t try to get information from this child about where the Orlandos had gone.<br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t talk about running away, Petey,&#x201d; she said at last, and rather reluctantly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not old enough to go anywhere without your mother. I&#x2019;m sure you know that.&#x201d;<br>He sniffed again. &#x201c;I go to school wifout my mother. Guess I can go where Granddaddy went wifout her. And I'm not scared of that great big ole green man wif the big red eyes and the horns. Last year I was sort of scared of him, but I&#x2019;m a big boy now. I&#x2019;m six, and when he goes dancing and hopping all around the cave I&#x2019;m just gonna laugh and laugh.&#x201d;<br>Trixie&#x2019;s curiosity got the better of the small voice of her conscience. &#x201c;What cave?&#x201d;<br>Petey glared at her. &#x201c;I just tole you. It&#x2019;s sort of a cavelike place. It&#x2019;s all dark and shadowy in the corners &#x2019;cause it&#x2019;s not lighted &#x2019;cept with candles. And then all the horrible peoples come in and dance around, &#x2019;cept that they isn&#x2019;t peoples. They is mostly sort of like animals.&#x201d; He tucked his thumbs through the straps of his overalls. &#x201c;I guess maybe my grandmommy is sort of scared of &#x2019;em, &#x2019;cause she didn&#x2019;t want to go this year, but then Tio came and he and Granddaddy talked loud and then Grandmommy began to pack and she wanted to take me wif her but my mommy kept saying, &#x2018;No, no, no!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>Then, aware of the fact that he had been shouting, he clapped a small hand over his mouth and raced inside the cabin.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Make Me: A Jack Reacher Novel</h2><p><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER � <b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>LOS ANGELES TIMES, THE GUARDIAN, </i>AND <i>SUSPENSE MAGAZINE</i></b>&nbsp;� Stephen King calls Jack Reacher &#x201c;the coolest continuing series character&#x201d;&#x2014;and now he&#x2019;s back in this masterly new thriller from Lee Child.</b><br><br> <i>&#x201c;Why is this town called Mother&#x2019;s Rest?&#x201d;</i> That&#x2019;s all Reacher wants to know.

It was like trying to wrestle a king-�size mattress off a waterbed. So they buried him close to the house. Which made sense anyway. The harvest was still a month away, and a disturbance in a field would show up from the air. And they would use the air, for a guy like Keever. They would use search planes, and helicopters, and maybe even drones.<br><br>They started at midnight, which they thought was safe enough. They were in the middle of ten thousand acres of nothingness, and the only man-�made structure their side of any horizon was the railroad track to the east, but midnight was five hours after the evening train and seven hours before the morning train. Therefore, no prying eyes. Their backhoe had four spotlights on a bar above the cab, the same way kids pimped their pick-�up trucks, and together the four beams made a wide pool of halogen brightness. Therefore, visibility was not a problem either. They started the hole in the hog pen, which was a permanent disturbance all by itself. Each hog weighed two hundred pounds, and each hog had four feet. The dirt was always chewed up. Nothing to see from the air, not even with a thermal camera. The picture would white out instantly, from the steaming animals themselves, and their steaming piles and pools of waste.<br><br>Safe enough.<br><br>Hogs were rooting animals, so they made sure the hole was deep. Which was not a problem either. Their backhoe&#x2019;s arm was long, and it bit rhythmically, in fluent articulated seven-�foot scoops, the hydraulic rams glinting in the electric light, the engine straining and roaring and pausing, the cab falling and rising, as each bucket-�load was dumped aside. When the hole was done they backed the machine up and turned it around and used the front bucket to push Keever into his grave, scraping him, rolling him, covering his body with dirt, until finally it fell over the lip and thumped down into the electric shadows.<br><br>Only one thing went wrong, and it happened right then.<br><br>The evening train came through five hours late. The next morning they heard on the AM station that a broken locomotive had caused a jam a hundred miles south. But they didn&#x2019;t know that at the time. All they heard was the mournful whistle at the distant crossing, and then all they could do was turn and stare, at the long lit cars rumbling past in the middle distance, one after the other, like a vision in a dream, seemingly forever. But eventually the train was gone, and the rails sang for a minute more, and then the tail light was swallowed by the midnight darkness, and they turned back to their task.<br><br>Twenty miles north the train slowed, and slowed, and then eased to a hissing stop, and the doors sucked open, and Jack Reacher stepped down to a concrete ramp in front of a grain elevator as big as an apartment house. To his left were four more elevators, all of them bigger than the first, and to his right was an enormous metal shed the size of an airplane hangar. There were vapor lights on poles, set at regular intervals, and they cut cones of yellow in the darkness. There was mist in the nighttime air, like a note on a calendar. The end of summer was coming. Fall was on its way.<br><br>Reacher stood still and behind him the train moved away without him, straining, grinding, settling to a slow rat-�a-�tat rhythm, and then accelerating, its building slipstream pulling at his clothes. He was the only passenger who had gotten out. Which was not surprising. The place was no kind of a commuter hub. It was all agricultural. What token passenger facilities it had were wedged between the last elevator and the huge shed, and were limited to a compact building, which seemed to have both a ticket window and benches for waiting. It was built in a traditional railroad style, and it looked like a child&#x2019;s toy, temporarily set down between two shiny oil drums.<br><br>But on a sign board running its whole length was written the reason Reacher was there: Mother&#x2019;s Rest. Which he had seen on a map, and which he thought was a great name for a railroad stop. He figured the line must cross an ancient wagon train trail, right there, where something had happened long ago. Maybe a young pregnant woman went into labor. The jostling could not have helped. Maybe the wagon train stopped for a couple of weeks. Or a month. Maybe someone remembered the place years later. A descendant, perhaps. A family legend. Maybe there was a one-�room museum.<br><br>Or perhaps there was a sadder interpretation. Maybe they had buried a woman there. Too old to make it. In which case there would be a commemorative stone.<br><br>Either way Reacher figured he might as well find out. He had no place to go, and all the time in the world to get there, so detours cost him nothing. Which is why he got out of the train. To a sense of disappointment, initially. His expectations had been way off base. He had pictured a couple of dusty houses, and a lonely one-�horse corral. And the one-�room museum, maybe run part-�time and volunteer by an old guy from one of the houses. Or the headstone, maybe marble, behind a square wrought-�iron fence.<br><br>He had not expected the immense agricultural infrastructure. He should have, he supposed. Grain, meet the railroad. It had to be loaded somewhere. Billions of bushels and millions of tons each year. He stepped left and looked through a gap between structures. The view was dark, but he could sense a rough semicircle of habitation. Houses, obviously, for the depot workers. He could see lights, which he hoped were a motel, or a diner, or both.<br><br>He walked to the exit, skirting the pools of vapor light purely out of habit, but he saw that the last lamp was unavoidable, because it was set directly above the exit gate. So he saved himself a further perimeter diversion by walking through the next-�to-�last pool of light, too.<br><br>At which point a woman stepped out of the shadows.<br><br>She came toward him with a distinctive burst of energy, two fast paces, eager, like she was pleased to see him. Her body language was all about relief.<br><br>Then it wasn&#x2019;t. Then it was all about disappointment. She stopped dead, and she said, &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;<br><br>She was Asian. But not petite. Five-�nine, maybe, or even five-� ten. And built to match. Not a bone in sight. No kind of a willowy waif. She was about forty, Reacher guessed, with black hair worn long, jeans and a T-�shirt under a short cotton coat. She had lace-�up shoes on her feet.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Good evening, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br><br>She was looking past his shoulder.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the only passenger.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked him in the eye.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;No one else got out of the train. So I guess your friend isn&#x2019;t coming.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My friend?&#x201d; she said. A neutral kind of accent. Regular American. The kind he heard everywhere.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Why else would a person be here, except to meet the train? No point in coming otherwise. I guess normally there would be nothing to see at midnight.&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t answer.<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;ve been waiting here since seven o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know the train was late,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no cell signal here. And no one from the railroad, to tell you anything. And I guess the Pony Express is out sick today.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t in my car. Or the next two, either.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who wasn&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your friend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what he looks like.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a big guy,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why you jumped out when you saw me. You thought I was him. For a second, anyway. And there were no big guys in my car. Or the next two.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When is the next train?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seven in the morning.&#x201d;<br><br>She said, &#x201c;Who are you and why have you come here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just a guy passing through.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The train passed through. Not you. You got out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know anything about this place?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you seen a museum or a gravestone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s asking?&#x201d;<br><br>She paused a beat, and said, &#x201c;Nobody.&#x201d;<br><br>Reacher said, &#x201c;Is there a motel in town?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a motel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Works for me,&#x201d; Reacher said. &#x201c;Does it have vacancies?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be amazed if it didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;OK, you can show me the way. Don&#x2019;t wait here all night. I&#x2019;ll be up by first light. I&#x2019;ll knock on your door as I leave. Hopefully your friend will be here in the morning.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman said nothing. She just glanced at the silent rails one more time, and then turned around and led the way through the exit gate.</p><h2>DIE FOR ME: The Terrifying True Story of the Charles Ng &amp; Leonard Lake Torture Muders</h2><p>When a shoplifting arrest leads to the shocking discovery of six bodies, a bag of bone fragments, a child&#39;s liver, and a videotape revealing horrifying murders, two twisted psychopaths whose orgy of sex crimes, torture, and murder claimed the lives of at least sixteen victims, are apprehended.

What emerges from his explorations is a revivified version of pragmatism that offers new hope for the future of philosophy.&#x201c;Rorty&#x2019;s dazzling tour through the history of modern philosophy, and his critical account of its present state (the best general introduction in print), is actually an argument that what we consider perennial problems--mind and body, consciousness and objects, the foundations of knowledge, the fact/value distinction--are merely the dead-ends this picture leads us into.&#x201d; Los Angeles Times Book Review &#x201c;It can immediately be said that Consequences of Pragmatism must be read by both those who believe that they agree and those who believe that they disagree with Richard Rorty. [He] is far and away the most provocative philosophical writer working in North America today, and Consequences of Pragmatism should make this claim even stronger.&#x201d;The Review of Metaphysics &#x201c;Philosophy, for Rorty, is a form of writing, a literary genre, closer to literary criticism than anything else, a criticism which takes for one of its major concerns the texts of the past recognized as philosophical: it interprets interpretations. If anyone doubts the continued vigor and continuing relevance of American pragmatism, the doubts can be laid to rest by reading this book.&#x201d; Religious Studies Review</p><p></p><h2>The Star Trek Encyclopedia : A Reference Guide to the Future</h2><p>This reference book, designed for &#34;Star Trek&#34; fans, brings together all three incarnations of the Star Trek phenomenon: the original &#34;Star Trek&#34;, &#34;The Next Generation&#34; and &#34;Deep Space Nine&#34;.

Meryman's primary focus is Wyeth's boyhood--a choice that, in this case, is appropriate: his lively youth and relationship with his colorful but overwhelming father, N. C. Wyeth, is not only of particular interest to young people but crucial to Andrew's development. N.C., who had hoped for recognition as a painter, was best known as a fine illustrator; he was also a respected teacher. Andrew was lucky to be the last of his five gifted children, thriving in the vibrant family milieu but also benefiting from some benign neglect. His own work is seen here as a rich, creative blend of N.C.'s rigorous instruction and fertile example, and of an artist's compelling need to find his own way. Countering the popular conception of Andrew as a throwback or traditionalist, Meryman points out both the emotional complexity of his subjects and their treatment and the intellectual nature of compositions that, like abstract art, are determined more by form and color than by content. The paintings reproduced are well chosen to represent Wyeth's development and range. A fascinating, entertaining, and beautiful book. Excellent color reproductions with full citations; b&amp;w photos; index. (Biography. 11+) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This book is a collection of his insights and experiences from those periods. Aimed at the general reader, it is a su perb introduction to South Africa today and is essential for community librar ies. It parallels James North's recent Freedom Rising ( LJ 5/1/85) but is gen erally better. Lelyveld's access to im portant people is broader, and his writ ing style is more colorful. On the neg ative side, Lelyveld's structure is un clear, and the excellent anecdotes can obscure the point of a chapter.

Since losing one leg and the use of the other in a 1986 accident, Dubus has experienced despair, learned acceptance, and, finally, found joy in the sacramental magic of even the most quotidian tasks.<br>Whether he is writing of the relationship with his father, the rape of his beloved sister, his Catholic faith, the suicide of a gay naval officer, his admiration for fellow writers like Hemingway and Mailer, or the simple act of making sandwiches for his daughters' lunchboxes, Dubus cuts straight to the heart of things. Here we have a master at the height of his powers, an artist whose work "is suffused with grace, bathed in a kind of spiritual glow" (The New York Times Book Review).</p><p>In his first book of essays, <i>Broken Vessels</i>, Andre Dubus uses experiences such as baseball games and sheep herding as occasions for insight. His second essay collection, <i>Meditations from a Movable Chair</i>, is about the people who have meant the most to him. The book conjures a cloud of witnesses--Dubus's father, his sister, Norman Mailer, Liv Ullmann, a gay military officer--so vividly that their gifts to Dubus become gifts to the reader, as well. Many of these people helped Dubus understand the holiness, even sacramentality, of everyday life, which he describes in explicitly Catholic terms. <i>Meditations from a Movable Chair</i> is a rare and wonderful thing--a book written out of love, whose richness of heart is expressed by an exacting and challenging mind. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"A rich account of the daily torments and triumphs of a human soul . . .

It was originally titled <em>Sick Sick Sick</em>, but Feiffer changed the name to, simply, <em>Feiffer</em>, because he got tired of explaining that the title referred to the society he was commenting on, not the nature of his humor, which, he insisted, was not sick.</p><p>Politically, the '50s was dominated by the insipid Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower; the backwash of Joe McCarthy; and the Cold War, which was in full swing. Culturally, the Beats were revolutionizing literature, Marlon Brando was changing the face of acting, and Elvis Presley was altering the public's perception of pop music. The post-war suburban bliss of the country was being challenged by sociologists and economists in books like <em>The Lonely Crowd</em>, <em>The Other America</em>, and <em>The Afflulent Society</em>. The civil rights movement was gaining momentum. Camelot was just around the corner, and would be shattered by the assassinations of JFK, RFK, and MLK. The Vietnam War would polarize the country. It was into this scrambled political-cultural climate that Jules Feiffer flung himself full throttle for the next ten years.</p><p>His strip tackled just about every issue, private and public, that affected the sentient American: relationships, sexuality, love, family, parents, children, psychoanalysis, neuroses, presidents, politicians, media, race, class, labor, religion, foreign policy, war, and one or two other existential questions. It was the first time that the American public had been subjected to a weekly dose of comics that so uncompromisingly and wittily confronted individuals' private fears and society's public transgressions. <em>Explainers</em> is the first of four volumes collecting Feiffer's entire run of weekly strips from <em>The Village Voice</em>. This edition contains approximately 500 strips originally published between 1956 and 1966 in a brick-like landscape hardcover format.</p></p><p>Jules Feiffer is a cartoonist, playwright, children&#x2019;s book author and illustrator, and member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Kleven has taken this simple story and given it style and heart. The events, some of which are either purely fanciful or highly unlikely, all seem authentic. Giving an inanimate object a believable personality is not an easy feat, and the author does a fine job of it. Her graceful phrases add a lyrical air, and emotions are described with a light and delicate touch. Her multimedium collages have never looked fresher or more interesting. The world she creates is not necessarily free from danger or sadness, yet it is predominantly full of beauty and sunlight.

He worked nights as a waiter, summers on construction gangs, and shot pool and played bridge with fraternity boys in order to make small change, and did whatever else he could to protect and supplement his university scholarship, living a mile from campus in a room without sink or closet or decent heating and stealing most of the food he ate, and when the University Hotel was robbed it was the Turk who had done it, an act of such speed the night porter couldn&#x2019;t say when it happened or who rushed in from the street to bludgeon him so murderously he took it in a personal way. On weekends the Turk tutored mediocrities in mathematics and French . . .</p><p>He picked her up at her dormitory, took her to a movie, and later, in his borrowed Chevrolet, drove her into the countryside and with heavy, crocodilean sentences communicated his agony amid the alien corn. She attended with quick, encouraging little nods and stared as if each word crept past her eyes and she felt power gathering in their difficult motion as he leaned toward her and with lips still laboring words made indelible sense, raping her, forcing her to variations of what she never heard of though she was a great reader of avant-garde novels and philosophical commentaries on the modern predicament . . .</p><p>In the cracking, desiccated leather of the Chevrolet she was susceptible to a distinction between life and sensibility, and dropped, like Leda by the swan, squirming, arching, so as not to be touched again, inadvertently, as he poked behind the cushions for the ignition key. She discovered it pulling up her pants and, because it required intelligent speech inconsistent with her moaning, couldn&#x2019;t bring it to his attention; nor would she squat, winding about in her privates, though she hated to see him waste time bunched up twisting wires under the dashboard.</p><p>Despite her wild compulsion to talk and despite the frightened, ravenous curiosity of her dormitory clique, whom she awakened by sobbing over their beds, Melanie wasn&#x2019;t able to say clearly what finished happening half an hour ago. She remembered the Turk suddenly abandoned English and raved at her in furious Turkish, and she told them about that and about the obscene tattoo flashing on his chest when she ripped his shirt open, and that he stopped the car on a country road and there was a tall hedge, maples, sycamores, and a railroad track nearby, and a train was passing, passing, and passing, and beyond it, her moans, and later an animal trotting quickly on the gravel, and then, with no discontinuity, the motor starting its cough and retch and a cigarette waving at her mouth already lighted as if the worst were over and someone had started thinking of her in another way.</p><p>The lights of the university town appeared and she smoked the cigarette as the car went down among them through empty streets, through the residential area of the ethical, economic community and twisted into the main street passing store after store. She saw an armless, naked manikin and felt like that, or like a thalidomide baby, all torso and short-circuited, and then they were into the streets around campus, narrow and shaky with trees, and neither of them said a word as he shifted gears, speeding and slowing and working the car through a passage irregular and yet steady, and enclosed within a greater passage as tangible as the internal arcs of their skulls. At the dormitory he stopped the car. She got out running.</p><p>Quigley, Berkowitz, and Sax could tell that Melanie Green had been assaulted with insane and exotic cruelty: there were fingerprints on her cheeks the color of tea stains and her stockings hung about her ankles like Hamlet&#x2019;s when he exposed himself to Ophelia and called her a whore. So they sucked cigarettes and urged her to phone the Dean of Women, the police, and the immigration authorities, as if disseminating the story among representatives of order would qualify it toward annihilation or render it accessible to a punitive response consistent with national foreign policy. Though none of them saw positive value in Melanie&#x2019;s experience it was true, nevertheless, in no future conversation would she complain about being nineteen and not yet discovered by the right man, as it happened, to rape with. Given her face and legs, that had always seemed sick, irritating crap, and in the pits of their minds, where there were neither words nor ideas but only raging morality, they took the Turk as poetic justice, fatal male, and measure for measure. Especially since he lived now in those pits vis-�-vis Melanie&#x2019;s father, a bearded rabbi with tear bags. "What if your father knew?" asked Quigley, making a gesture of anxious speculation, slender hands turned out flat, palms up, like a Balinese dancer. Melanie felt annoyed, but at least Quigley was there, sticking out her hands, and could be relied on always to be symbolic of whatever she imagined the situation required.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t tell the rabbi, the Dean of Women, police, or immigration authorities, and didn&#x2019;t tell Harry Stone, her fianc�, with whom she had never had all-the-way sexual intercourse because he feared it might destroy the rhythm of his graduate work in Classics. But once, during Christmas vacation, she flew East to visit him, and while standing on a stairway in Cambridge, after dinner and cognac, he let her masturbate him and then lay in bed beside her, brooding, saying little except "I feel like Seymour," and she answering, "I&#x2019;m sorry." Quigley, Berkowitz, and Sax called him "Harry the fairy," but never in the presence of Melanie, who read them his letters, brilliantly exquisite and full of ruthless wit directed at everything, and the girls screamed and could hardly wait till he got his degree and laid her. "It&#x2019;ll be made of porcelain," said Sax, and Melanie couldn&#x2019;t refute the proposition (though the girls always told her everything they did with their boyfriends and she owed them the masturbation story) because they were too hot for physiology and wouldn&#x2019;t listen to the whole story, wouldn&#x2019;t hear its tone or any of its music. They were critical, sophisticated girls and didn&#x2019;t dig mood, didn&#x2019;t savor things. They were too fast, too eager to get the point.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t tell the rabbi or any other authority about the rape, and wouldn&#x2019;t dream of telling Harry Stone because he tended to become irrationally jealous and like homosexual Othello would assume she had gone out with armies of men aside from the Turk,which wasn&#x2019;t true. The Turk had been a casual decision, the only one of its kind, determined by boredom with classes and dateless weekends, and partly by a long-distance phone call to Harry Stone in the middle of the night when she needed his voice and he expressed irritation at having been disturbed while translating a difficult passage of Thucydides for a footnote in his dissertation. Furthermore the Turk was interesting-looking, black eyes, a perfect white bite of teeth between a biggish nose and a cleft chin, and because he was pathetic in his tortuous English going out with him seemed merely an act of charity indifferently performed and it was confirmed as such when he arrived in the old Chevrolet and suggested a cowboy movie. He held the door open for her, which she could never expect Harry to do, and he tried to talk to her. To her, she felt&#x2014;though it was clear that his effort to talk depended very much on her effort to listen.</p><p>She went to parties on the two weekends following the rape and sat in darkened rooms while a hashish pipe went around and said things too deep for syntax and giggled hysterically, and in the intimate delirium of faces and darkness asked how one might get in touch with an abortionist if, perchance, one needed one. She didn&#x2019;t talk about the rape but remembered the Turk had held her chin and she felt guilty but resistless and saw that his eyes didn&#x2019;t focus and that, more than anything, lingered in her nerves, like birds screaming and inconsummate. She asked her clique about the signs of pregnancy, then asked herself if she wasn&#x2019;t peeing more than usual. It seemed to spear down very hot and hard and longer than before, but she ascribed it to sphincters loosened upon the violent dissolution of the veil between vaginal post and lintel. When she asked the girls about an abortionist they laughed maniacally at the idea that any of them might know such a person,but, one at a time, appeared in her room to whisper names and telephone numbers and tell her about the different techniques and the anesthetic she might expect if the man were considerate or brave enough to give her one. "They&#x2019;re afraid of the cops," said Sax, a tough number from Chicago who had been knocked up twice in her freshman year."They want you out of the office as soon as possible."</p><p>Harry surprised her by coming to town during his intersession break and she was so glad to see him she trembled. She introduced him to her house mother and her clique and he ate dinner with her in the dormitory the first night. The next day he went to classes with her and that evening they ate in the best restaurant in town, which wasn&#x2019;t nearly as good as some Harry knew in the East but it was pretty good, and then they walked in the Midwestern twilight, watching swallows, listening to night hawks whistle, and she felt an accumulation of sympathy in the minutes and the hours, which became an urge, a possibility, and then a strong need to tell him, but she chatted mainly about her clique and said,"Quigley has funny nipples and Berkowitz would have a wonderful figure except for her thighs, which have no character. I love Sax&#x2019;s figure. It&#x2019;s like a skinny boy&#x2019;s." Harry made an indifferent face and shrugged in his tweeds, but quick frowns twitched after the facts and she went on, encouraged thus, going on, to go on a...</p></p><h2>Mushrooms and Truffles of the Southwest</h2><p><b>The American Southwest</b> is not usually thought of as a habitat for mushrooms, yet its various life zones are home to a surprising number of fungi and related species. This first book on the region's mushrooms and truffles provides descriptions and color illustrations for 156 major species and additional descriptive references for 155 more. Also included are selected slime molds and lichens, which, like truffles, usually are not covered in mushroom guides at all. The book's range is Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and northern Mexico. It is designed to help fungiphiles not only identify mushrooms but also find them. The author describes the life zones where fungi can be found in association with characteristic plant communities and provides maps--with major landmarks indicated--designating conifer forests on public land where mushrooms are most often found. The major classifications covered are Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes), Stomach Fungi (Gasteromycetes), Sac Fungi (Ascomycetes), and Tuberlike Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. A special feature of the guide is the provision of cross references to other field guides, reinforcing the need to confirm identification before consuming mushrooms.

Kopp</b>&nbsp;(1929&#x2013;1999) was a psychotherapist and teacher of psychotherapy in Washington, D.C. He published in such publications as&nbsp;<i>Psychology Today</i>,&nbsp;<i>American Journal of Psychotherapy,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Psychiatric Quarterly</i>, and was the author of&nbsp;<i>Guru, The Hanged Man,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him!</i></p><h2>The New Kitchen Garden</h2><p>Explains how to create beautiful gardens with a wide range of fruits and vegetables, detailing how to incorporate fresh produce into all types of formal and informal gardens and providing expert advice on cultivation, garden design, and more.</p><p>"To Vanessa," runs the dedication to Anna Pavord's yardstick manual of creative kitchen gardening, "who planted a weed garden." None of your boring rows of antediluvian cabbages here, then: Pavord's vision of a "new kitchen garden" is a flexible contemporary version of that long-vanished institution, the potager, a garden where special vegetables were grown with flowering plants in arrangements that were both productive and pleasing to the eye. Pavord's contemporary spins on the theme include an alcoholic hedge and a city larder, but traditional designs get a look-in, too; even the oh-so-precious formal herb garden receives a much-needed fillip of imagination and color. <p> Pavord traces the historical accidents that set vegetables off from flowering plants, to the detriment of both, in an introduction full of the "buttery bonus" of artichokes and the "elegiac performance of a mature pear." Past the verbiage lie row upon row of well-tended plant lists; instructions on planting, growing, harvesting, and storing; recommended cultivars; and homely recipes to feed that Laura Ashley moment. DK Living's surgical house layout has set many a set of teeth on edge in the past, but there's no denying its clarity and usefulness in a book so rich in information and advice. </p><p> For Pavord, growing food is our last and best connection to the earth. Evoking the paradisal gardens of a time when growing food meant survival, Pavord assures the reader that "there is no reason why you too should not be in that same state of delicious fluctuation." And you can't say anything fairer than that. <i>--Simon Ings, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Pavord writes on gardening from England's milder shores, but from the expert counsel she provides here on the popular topic of kitchen gardens to a final suppliers' list, this work is clearly aimed at U.S. gardeners. Overall, the focus is on how to plan and care for a garden that will delight the eyes and perhaps eventually fortify the larder with rations of delectable produce. Pavord offers plenty of ideas for combining herbs, flowers, fruiting trees and bushes, and appealing varieties of annual and perennial flowers. The colorfully illustrated designs include traditional, formal styles along with more accessible, basic mixed plantings. Pavord's inspirational sourcebook is also a handsome bet for dreamy imaginings by gardeners with limited resources and little space. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>Emma</h2><p>1996, hardcover reprint edition, State Street Press / Borders, Ann Arbor, MI. 540 pages, beautifully done title bound in green cloth. Nicely printed, heavy stock. Emma is one of Jane Austen&#39;s best novels, the fourth one published. Jane Austen&#39;s saved up manuscripts were first published between 1811 and 1818. She died in 1817 at the age of 41.</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>News from Tartary</h2><p>Peter Fleming&#39;s account of his 1935 bid to travel the ancient trade route from China to India known as the &#39;Silk Road&#39;.</p><p>9 1.5-hour cassettes<p>Peter Fleming is an invasive species specialist with 28 years experience in research at the Vertebrate Pest Research Unit of the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSWDPI).</p></p><h2>Under the Egg</h2><p>Amazon Editors recommend this book for readers who want books with more complexity and length (with content suitable for a pre-teen audience).<br><br><b><i>From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.

Just&nbsp;cast your eyes past the row of gleaming town&nbsp;houses, with their uniform brick facades and polished&nbsp;brass plaques and, in some cases, packs of&nbsp;paparazzi.&nbsp;<br><br>Then find the one house that looks like the residents&nbsp;are ready to just pack it in and get that condo&nbsp;in Florida.<br><br> That&#x2019;s ours.<br><br> It wasn&#x2019;t always like this. Great-great-great-great-grandfather&nbsp;Tenpenny made a fortune in shipping&nbsp;and found himself an elegant street (formerly a&nbsp;hardscrabble thicket, or &#x201c;spinney&#x201d;) to build himself&nbsp;not one, but two town houses: one for his wife and&nbsp;children, and an adjoining one for his mother, complete&nbsp;with connecting doorways on each floor.<br><br> As it turns out, this building boom represented&nbsp;the peak of the Tenpenny fortune, and a year later&nbsp;the adjoining town house had been rented out and&nbsp;Grandma moved in with the rest of the family. As&nbsp;time went on, Greenwich Village was abandoned as&nbsp;the city&#x2019;s elite moved farther and farther uptown,&nbsp;but we Tenpennys stayed put.<br><br>On that hot July day, I used my new sneakers to&nbsp;kick the business cards and flyers (&#x201c;Dear Occupant,&nbsp;Do you need cash&#x2014;and quick? Let Town Home&nbsp;Realty handle your home sale!&#x201d;) off the stoop and&nbsp;jiggled the front door&#x2019;s brass doorknob until it finally&nbsp;surrendered.<br><br>No warm welcome here. Just the hot, stale parlor,&nbsp;silent and thick with the smell of musty books and&nbsp;last winter&#x2019;s pop-in from a stray cat. With Jack by&nbsp;my side, the room held a certain artistic-eccentric&nbsp;charm: an antique desk repaired with an oak branch&nbsp;in place of a leg, an ottoman made out of Yellow&nbsp;Pages bound together with sailor&#x2019;s knots, autumn&nbsp;leaves ironed between sheets of waxed paper and&nbsp;wallpapered around the room. But now, alone, with&nbsp;the autumn leaves drifting to the ground as the glue&nbsp;gave out, the place just looked odd, like a stylish&nbsp;great-aunt who has begun wearing her wig backward.<br><br>A breeze from the dining room windows brought&nbsp;in the clucking of our backyard chickens, probably&nbsp;thirsty and impatient for dinner. Jack had started a&nbsp;little garden plot back there in the Great Depression,&nbsp;and now that garden had taken over the entire&nbsp;lot, including not just rows of veggies, but an apple&nbsp;tree, a raspberry bush, and a well-built coop for a&nbsp;fine flock of chickens.<br><br>At least for now. I&#x2019;d lost one this week to a Jurassic-sized&nbsp;rat. Camille had been a tough old broad; she&nbsp;could&#x2019;ve taken that rat. But since Jack died, I think&nbsp;we&#x2019;d all had the fight knocked out of us.<br><br> The grandfather clock in the corner struck five&nbsp;low tones. The chickens would have to wait. It was<br> teatime.<br>The stairs to the second floor creaked under my&nbsp;weight, made heavier by the tarnished silver tray<br> with hard-boiled eggs and a chipped teapot, which I&nbsp;carried like a waitress.<br><br>Using my free hand, I gave three knocks. No&nbsp;answer.<br><br> Mom didn&#x2019;t so much as glance up from her desk&nbsp;as I pushed my way in. From the door I could see&nbsp;beads of sweat running down the back of her neck,&nbsp;below a knot of straw-colored hair bound up absently&nbsp;with a pencil. She wore her terry-cloth bathrobe,&nbsp;even in the stifling, dank room, with its scent of fermenting&nbsp;tea bags and dirty laundry.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got your tea.&#x201d; I set the tray on the floor next&nbsp;to her chair. Mom got pretty agitated if I put anything&nbsp;on her desk, which was blanketed in yellow&nbsp;papers filled with numbers and cryptic characters.&nbsp;She said nothing and continued scratching a&nbsp;pencil on her latest legal pad.<br><br>Jack said my mom was always a bit &#x201c;off,&#x201d; even as a&nbsp;little girl. It&#x2019;s not that she was crazy or even slow. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;just that she always preferred the world inside her&nbsp;mind to the world outside.<br><br>I can understand this, not having much to do with&nbsp;the neighborhood kids myself. I&#x2019;ve never met one&nbsp;who could even tell you the difference between a&nbsp;standard and a Phillips head. But Jack said Angelika&nbsp;was different than all that. She used to go out,&nbsp;help with chores, go to school. Her teachers and&nbsp;professors used words like &#x201c;genius&#x201d; and &#x201c;extraordinarily&nbsp;gifted.&#x201d; But as the years went by, she withdrew&nbsp;deeper and deeper within herself, and now here she&nbsp;was, at her childhood desk in her childhood room,&nbsp;working on a dissertation that NYU stopped expecting&nbsp;over fifteen years ago.<br><br>Since Jack&#x2019;s death, she&#x2019;d started refusing to leave&nbsp;her desk at all, save for her daily morning walk to&nbsp;the tea shop, where she religiously collected every&nbsp;variety they sold. But I caught her last week trying&nbsp;to leave the house in her bathrobe, so clearly things&nbsp;were going south.<br><br> My dad I don&#x2019;t know at all. My mother barely did&nbsp;either. Jack said he was a grifter who seduced my&nbsp;mom just to get his hands on the deed to our house.&nbsp;He sent the guy running.<br><br>I started to gather up the stray teacups from the&nbsp;windowsill, crouching to snag a few from under<br> the bed.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the dissertation going, Mom?&#x201d;<br><br> Scritch scratch.<br><br> &#x201c;Solving any theorems?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I thought I&#x2019;d made a breakthrough, but&nbsp;clearly the unique factorization approach won&#x2019;t<br> work.&#x201d; She shook her head, never looking up from&nbsp;her notepad. &#x201c;Unique factorization. Silly.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Huh.&#x201d; I sat down on the bed and its tangle of&nbsp;sheets. &#x201c;Mom, have you given any more thought&nbsp;to what we talked about? About selling the house?&nbsp;We could get a lot of money for it, I think. And we&nbsp;could get an apartment somewhere else in the city,&nbsp;maybe Brooklyn or Queens or somewhere cheaper&nbsp;like that.&#x201d;<br><br> Mom&#x2019;s pencil paused in the air, and she turned&nbsp;her sallow face slowly to stare at me. &#x201c;What house?&#x201d;&nbsp;she asked, her voice low.<br><br> &#x201c;Um, this one?&#x201d;<br><br> She dropped her pencil, her hands shaking. &#x201c;Sell&nbsp;this house? But where would I work? My desk has&nbsp;always been right here. It&#x2019;s the perfect place; I can&nbsp;see the birds in the tree outside. See their nest?&nbsp;That&#x2019;s just where I look when I am working on an&nbsp;equation. And my bed is right here,&#x201d; she waved her&nbsp;hand in my direction, &#x201c;in the perfect spot, so the&nbsp;light can fall on my pillow in the morning. Sell the&nbsp;house? No, no, no, it&#x2019;s just not possible.&#x201d; Her voice&nbsp;became higher and thinner as she shook her head&nbsp;wildly, and I noticed she had started winding a loose&nbsp;thread from her bathrobe tightly around one finger.&nbsp;&#x201c;And where would I buy my tea? Madame Dumont&nbsp;always has the perfect blend ready&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Mom, okay. We&#x2019;re not going anywhere,&#x201d; I&nbsp;broke in. &#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Because all my papers are here, my archives, you&nbsp;see.&#x201d; She frantically pawed the piles and scraps that&nbsp;surrounded her. &#x201c;And I still have to organize them,&nbsp;put them in order, and my footnotes&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not selling the house, okay?&#x201d; I stood up&nbsp;brusquely, knocking two teacups off her book-cluttered&nbsp;night table, which rolled under the bed.&nbsp;&#x201c;But, Mom, I&#x2019;m serious. We can&#x2019;t afford all this.&#x201d;&nbsp;My hand waved over the mess, as if I were surveying&nbsp;the Taj Mahal. &#x201c;And when winter comes, there&#x2019;s the&nbsp;gas bill and the electric bill. I&#x2019;m not sure how much&nbsp;longer the boiler is going to hold out. How are we&nbsp;going to pay for that?&#x201d;<br><br> Now she was humming again.<br><br> &#x201c;Mom, are you sure Jack didn&#x2019;t mention anything&nbsp;about a secret stash? Somewhere he would have hidden&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know, money? Jewels? You know, like a&nbsp;treasure?&#x201d;<br><br> No answer.<br><br> I began to collect the teacups again. &#x201c;Should I&nbsp;bring up some dinner in a little while?&#x201d;<br><br> I looked up to see her dangling the Lipton tea&nbsp;bag in front of her eyes, hot drops of tea splattering&nbsp;the papers that carpeted the floor. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my vanilla&nbsp;Rooibos?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The Rooibos tea is gone, Mom. And that&#x2019;s what&nbsp;I&#x2019;m talking about. You can&#x2019;t buy these expensive teas&nbsp;from the shop anymore. I got this kind for you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But vanilla Rooibos is my afternoon tea. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;made with Madagascar vanilla, which is the finest vanilla,&nbsp;at least that&#x2019;s what Madame Dumont says. I&#x2019;ll&nbsp;get some more in the morning. Madame Dumont&nbsp;said she&#x2019;d have a new shipment of Golden Assam&nbsp;ready for me . . .&#x201d;<br><br> I closed the door behind me as my mother began&nbsp;to methodically categorize the differences between&nbsp;Indian and Chinese tea leaves.<br> After tending to the garden, the chickens, and some&nbsp;clogged gutters, I took my own dinner to the top&nbsp;floor and the room that was once Jack&#x2019;s studio. Jack&nbsp;and I had traditionally sat down together in the old&nbsp;dining room, where we&#x2019;d spoon up our rice and&nbsp;beans on the Tenpenny china and then send our&nbsp;dishes back down to the kitchen in the dumbwaiter.&nbsp;But now the big dining table felt cold, even in the&nbsp;heat, and I preferred to eat somewhere more filled&nbsp;with Jack&#x2019;s presence.<br><br> The studio was stuffy with paint fumes, and I&nbsp;cracked the tall windows that lined the studio&#x2019;s<br> back wall, letting in the relative cool of early evening&nbsp;and snatches of rush hour car horns. From my&nbsp;favorite spot on the long window seat, you could&nbsp;see the block&#x2019;s patchwork of yards below and catch&nbsp;glimpses of the Hudson River. Sometimes I&#x2019;d sit&nbsp;and watch the pigeon flocks swoop back and forth&nbsp;over the rooftops. Funny how something so ragged&nbsp;on its own can become so beautiful when banded&nbsp;together.<br><br> As I ate, I riffled through the mail I&#x2019;d brought up&nbsp;with me. One official-looking letter, with a large seal&nbsp;featuring an American eagle, fell to the floor. The&nbsp;return address: the Department of Veteran Affairs.<br> To whom it may concern:<br><br> The Department of Veterans Affairs was&nbsp;recently alerted of the death of&nbsp;John Thornton Tenpenny V.&nbsp;This letter is to notify you that all existing&nbsp;and future VA pension benefits will be hereby&nbsp;terminated.<br><br>Please accept our condolences at this time of&nbsp;your bereavement. Mr. Tenpenny&#x2019;s sacrifice and&nbsp;service to his country are deeply appreciated.&nbsp;<br><br>Sincerely yours,<br><br> Roger D. Fowlke<br> Department of Veterans Affairs<br> I read the letter several times over. Veterans Affairs?&nbsp;When I did my sixth-grade history fair project&nbsp;on World War II, Jack told me he sat out the whole&nbsp;thing on account of his asthma. It seemed strange&nbsp;that the VA would hand out pensions to 4-Fs with&nbsp;breathing issues.<br><br>More to the point, the letter meant that Jack had&nbsp;run the household with money I&#x2019;d never known<br> about. Money that had now dried up.&nbsp;I put the letter down and reached for a Mason&nbsp;jar, tucked in with assorted paint cans and bottles of&nbsp;paint thinner. The jar had once held some sky blue&nbsp;paint, now dried and opaque, which hid the bills&nbsp;and coins inside. Jack had always kept five hundred&nbsp;dollars in this jar, spending it down to the pennies,&nbsp;and then replenishing with a fresh five hundred&nbsp;from some unknown source.<br><br> Once, when I was around five, Jack caught me&nbsp;trying to sneak some change out to buy a candy&nbsp;bar. He roared&#x2014;the only time he ever directed his&nbsp;famous temper at me&#x2014;enraged more by the betrayal&nbsp;than the theft. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s a magic jar,&#x201d; I gasped&nbsp;between my sobs. &#x201c;You take money out, and it always&nbsp;comes back.&#x201d; He got down on one knee, his strong,&nbsp;paint-flecked hands gripping my shoulders. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not&nbsp;magic. It&#x2019;s hard work that fills that jar. The hard work&nbsp;of earning the money, and the harder work of keeping&nbsp;it.&#x201d; His hands moved to my cheeks, wiping the&nbsp;tears into his calloused palms. &#x201c;Now, don&#x2019;t cry, sister.&nbsp;You&#x2019;ll see&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll make sure there&#x2019;s always money to be&nbsp;found.&#x201d;<br><br>Tonight I poured out the jar&#x2019;s contents and&nbsp;counted it again&#x2014;$384. On the day Jack died, there&nbsp;had been $463. I guess I was lucky that he died only&nbsp;a week after refilling the jar. From that day forward,&nbsp;I had done the hard work of keeping what we had:&nbsp;eating only from the garden and the pantry, avoiding&nbsp;our few functional appliances even as the red-lined&nbsp;utility bills kept streaming through the mail slot. I&#x2019;d&nbsp;even given up the Laundromat, hand-washing my&nbsp;sweaty clothes in the kitchen sink and drying them&nbsp;on the backyard line.<br><br>Still, no matter how hard I worked, the money&nbsp;couldn&#x2019;t hold out forever. Jack was right&#x2014;the only&nbsp;magic around here was the money&#x2019;s disappearing&nbsp;act.<br><br>That left us only one lifeline: Jack&#x2019;s promised&nbsp;&#x201c;treasure.&#x201d; I popped a last raspberry in my mouth&nbsp;and crossed over to the studio&#x2019;s defunct fireplace,&nbsp;where atop a grand marble mantel a chicken egg sat&nbsp;in a small ceramic bowl.<br><br>My first official chore in the Tenpenny house had&nbsp;been the placement of that egg. Every morning, Jack&nbsp;and I would gather the chickens&#x2019; output and select&nbsp;the whitest, most perfect egg of the lot. The rest of the&nbsp;half dozen or so went to the kitchen. The egg of&nbsp;honor went to the mantel. Jack would lift me in his&nbsp;arms, and I&#x2019;d gently place the egg in the bowl made&nbsp;by my grandmother, a woman I knew only through&nbsp;Jack&#x2019;s stories of her skill at the potter&#x2019;s wheel and&nbsp;her fine Scandanavian cooking.<br><br>&#x201c;A new day, a new beginning, a new chance at a&nbsp;new ending,&#x201d; Jack would intone solemnly. It was as&nbsp;close as he ever got to morning prayers.&nbsp;<br><br>The egg would sit in its place of honor through&nbsp;the day until it was replaced by the next morning&#x2019;s&nbsp;selection, when it joined the other eggs in the kitchen.<br><br>But for that one day, its only job was to echo the&nbsp;painting above it. One of Jack&#x2019;s earliest pieces,<br> the canvas was an abstract, a dark swirling abyss of&nbsp;midnight blues, black like charred wood, and gray&nbsp;like the dawn. And floating in this void was a stark&nbsp;white oval that haloed the real egg below.<br><br>Canvases came and went in Jack&#x2019;s studio&#x2014;sold,&nbsp;lent, shown&#x2014;but this one stayed above the mantel,&nbsp;supervising the Changing of the Egg each morning.&nbsp;Jack said he&#x2019;d never sell it. I don&#x2019;t think I ever saw&nbsp;him so much as move it for dusting.<br><br> That was before The Spot on Spinney Street. And&nbsp;his last words.<br><br> Since then, every night after dinner, I worked into&nbsp;the last moments of the day&#x2019;s light to find out whether&nbsp;there was anything &#x201c;under the egg&#x201d; at all.<br><br>Maybe &#x201c;under the egg&#x201d; was just the last random&nbsp;outburst of a blood-soaked brain. But Jack always&nbsp;said he&#x2019;d take care of me. He always said I&#x2019;d find out&nbsp;when I was ready. It stood to reason that, whatever&nbsp;there was to find, was indeed under the egg.<br><br>The only problem was that &#x201c;under the egg&#x201d; could&nbsp;mean a lot of things&#x2014;and whatever it meant, I hadn&#x2019;t&nbsp;figured it out.

The very act of reading and the choice of reading material endow individuals with an identity that possesses great symbolic significance. In ancient Rome, Cicero was busy drawing up a hierarchy of different types of readers. Since that time, people have been divided into a variety of categories--literates and illiterates, intensive and extensive readers, or <i>vulgo </i>and discreet readers. In the 19th century, accomplished readers were praised as "men of letters," while their moral opposites were described as "unlettered." Today, distinctions are made between cultural and instrumental readers and scorn is directed toward the infamous "tabloid reader."</p><p> <i>Power of Reading</i> explores the changing meanings attributed to the act of reading. Although it has a historical perspective, the book's focus is very much on the culture of reading that prevails in the 21st century. It is a fascinating insight into understanding the post-Gutenberg debates about literacy in a multimedia environment with such a strong emphasis on the absorption of information. Taking a cue from George Steiner, Furedi argues vigorously for the restoration of the art of reading--every bit as important as the art of writing.</p></p><p><b>Frank Furedi</b> fled to England in 1956 from Hungary.

Rather, it is a Dickensian tale of good deeds rewarded and crimes punished.<p> The wintry story begins on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with 18-year-old Sondra Lewis, an aspiring violinist, tearfully leaving her baby on the steps of St. Clement's Church. Unbeknownst to her, Lenny Centino is robbing that same church on the same night, with his attention particularly on the Church's diamond inlaid chalice. He finds a buggy outside the church and uses it for cover as he flees. Only later does he realize that his take for the night includes the infant Stellina (Italian for <i>star</i>). The narrative then abruptly moves ahead seven years. Clark's lottery-winning protagonists, Alvirah and her husband Willy (introduced in <i>Weep No More, My Lady</i>) return for some amateur sleuthing. Sister Cordelia's thrift shop doubles as an after-school recreation place for neighborhood children (including a shy little girl named Star), but the building has been condemned. Bessie Maher had vowed she was leaving the house to the nun and her children. Now that she is gone, the will indicates that the tenants of the house, Vic and Linda Baker, are the true heirs. As December rushes on towards Christmas, Alvirah struggles to put things right before the children are left in the cold.</p><p> Like the best holiday stories, <i>All Through the Night</i> steers toward sentimentality, but it veers back on course with narrative wit and Alvirah's charm. Clark's prose is lean and her plotting is brisk. This is a mystery that would be a pleasure to share aloud with a family gathered at the fireplace for some holiday cheer. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>With Silent Night, the Queen of Suspense gave her readers the perfect Christmas present. Now Mary Higgins Clark celebrates the season again with a riveting new novel, about which USA Today said, Mary Higgins Clark fans will find ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT a "consume-in-one-sitting Christmas treat".<p>When Alvirah and Willy, two of Clark's most beloved characters, become caught up in a Christmas mystery, all of Alvirah's deductive powers and Willy's world-class common sense are called upon. It begins when an unmarried woman leaves her newborn on the rectory doorstep of a Manhattan church. Meanwhile, a small-time thief and drug peddler is absconding from the church with a treasured artifact, a chalice adorned with a single star-shaped diamond. To elude the police, he grabs the stroller and disappears.</p><p>Seven years later, the young mother returns to the church where her child was kidnapped while Alvirah and Willy are helping neighborhood kids prepare for a Christmas pageant at an after-school shelter. But the future of the shelter is threatened when the city condemns the site and it is learned that the brownstone to which the shelter was moving has been willed to a smooth-talking couple, tenants in the building. Suspecting that the will is a fake and the tenants con artists, Alvirah sets out to discover the truth. Soon she finds herself in the middle of the puzzle of the missing child and chalice.</p></p><h2>Butchers Hill (Tess Monaghan Novel, 3)</h2><p>Tess Monaghan has finally made the move and hung out her shingle as a p.i.-for-hire, complete with an office in Butchers Hill.

From the Newbery Project: &#34;2002 Newbery Medal Winner Tree-Ear is a young orphan boy who lives under a bridge with his companion, Crane-man, in 12th century Korea. The two friends never know where their next meal is coming from, but what is lacking in food and money is made up for in heart and friendship. When Tree-Ear is not scrounging for scraps of food, he watches master potter Min make his beautiful Korean Celadon pottery. One day he can&#39;t resist picking up a beautiful piece of pottery and ends up damaging the work. Because he can&#39;t repay Min in money, he agrees to work for Min to repay him in hopes of learning from this master potter. But Min has other things in store, and Tree-Ear finds himself doing excruciating manual labor. When the king sends his emissary to find potters for a lifelong commission, Tree-Ear finds himself going on a journey that forever changes his life. A Single Shard is a beautifully written and emotional novel about friendship, hope, love, and acceptance. Here&#39;s a passage near the beginning of the novel that particularly spoke to me: The gentle curves of the vase, its mysterious green color. The sharp angle of the plum twigs, their blackness stark amid the airy white blossoms. The work of a human, the work of nature; clay from the earth, a branch from the sky. A kind of peace spread through Tree-Ear, body and mind, as if while he looked at the vase and its branch, nothing could ever go wrong in the world. (p. 52) But things do go wrong in the world as we witness Tree-Ear on both his physical journey and his emotional journey in the book. Through Tree-Ear&#39;s story, the reader also learns a lot about pottery making during the 12th century and the hard work involved in creating one single piece of celadon pottery. The Author&#39;s Note at the end of the book along with an essay about celadon pottery teach us more about the time period and the art of creating this rare and beautiful pottery...&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Farewell to Fairacre</h2><p>Having enjoyed robust health throughout her career, Miss Read is looking forward to an energetic retirement in a few years&#39; time.

Taylor<br>Newbery Award-winning author, Mildred D. Taylor, was born in Jackson, Mississippi, and grew up in Toledo, Ohio. After graduating from the University of Toledo, she spent two years in Ethiopia with the Peace Corps teaching English and history. Returning to the United States, Ms. Taylor entered the University of Colorado's School of Journalism, from which she received her Master of Arts degree. As a member of the Black Student Alliance, she worked with students and University officials in structuring a Black Studies program at the University. She currently lives in Colorado.<br>"From as far back as I can remember, my father taught me a different history from the one I learned in school. By the fireside in our Ohio home and in Mississippi, where I was born and where my father's family had lived since the days of slavery, I had heard about our past. It was not an organized history beginning in a certain year, but one told through stories--stories about great-grandparents and aunts and uncles and others that stretched back through the years of slavery and beyond. It was a history of ordinary people, some brave, some not so brave, but basically people who had done nothing more spectacular than survive in a society designed for their destruction."The Friendship , set in Mississippi in 1933, relates the unexpected consequences when Cassie Logan, the heroine of Taylor's Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry , sees a black customer call a white storekeeper by his first name. In The Gold Cadillac , a black family encounters ignorance and prejudice during a drive from their Toledo home to Mississippi in their brand-new 1950 Cadillac. Both stories depict Taylor's customary sensitivity to racial issues.

Gutted by deindustrialization, outsourcing, and middle-class flight, disproportionately devastated by metro freeway systems that laid waste to the urban fabric and displaced the working poor, small industrial cities seem to be part of America's past, not its future. And yet, Catherine Tumber argues in this provocative book, America's gritty Rust Belt cities could play a central role in a greener, low-carbon, relocalized future.</p><p>As we wean ourselves from fossil fuels and realize the environmental costs of suburban sprawl, we will see that small cities offer many assets for sustainable living not shared by their big city or small town counterparts, including population density and nearby, fertile farmland available for new environmentally friendly uses.</p><p>Tumber traveled to twenty-five cities in the Northeast and Midwest -- from Buffalo to Peoria to Detroit to Rochester -- interviewing planners, city officials, and activists, and weaving their stories into this exploration of small-scale urbanism. Smaller cities can be a critical part of a sustainable future and a productive green economy. <i>Small, Gritty, and Green </i>will help us develop the moral and political imagination we need to realize this.</p></p><p>Historian and journalist Catherine Tumber is a Visiting Scholar at Northeastern University&#39;s School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs, a Fellow of the Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth&#39;s Gateway Cities Innovation Institute, and a former Research Affiliate with the MIT Department of Urban Studies and Planning&#39;s Community Innovators Lab.<p>"As the former mayor of a mid-sized, declining Northeastern city, I have long argued that the only attention which comes our way is when something negative happens: a major employer leaving town, a failed economic development venture, or a significant outbreak of violent crime. We were rarely seen as centers of innovation and ingenuity, or as having the assets to revitalize ourselves. Now Catherine Tumber has laid out a coherent path for recovery and revitalization of these small-to-medium-sized industrial cities. Hers is based not on academic theory but on observation of what is in place and what possibilities actually exist. Her prescriptions do not rely on pity but on how to play a winning hand." -- <b>William A. Johnson, Jr.</b>, Distinguished Professor of Public Policy and Urban Studies, Rochester Institute of Technology, Mayor of Rochester, 1994-2005</p><br><br><p>"This is a clear and intelligent call for Americans to find the great value waiting in the many small cities across this land. At a time in history when everything has to get smaller, finer, and more local, these places occupy increasingly important geographic sites and need to be brought back to life. Catherine Tumber understands the dynamic completely and lays it out eloquently." -- <b>James Howard Kunstler</b>, author of the novels <i>The Long Emergency</i> and <i>World Made by Hand</i></p><br><br><p>" <i>Small, Gritty, and Green</i> shows how small and mid-sized rust-belt cities can serve as models for sustainable urban living. Tumber's thesis is presented in a fast-moving mix of history, original interviews, and assessment of received urban planning wisdom. Her compelling argument is that planners, politicians, and the general populace would be wise to try something completely different and that these cities, though largely invisible in past scholarship, represent an important pathway to the future." -- <b>Peggy F.

Now, Ricky Riccardi&#x2014;jazz scholar and musician&#x2014;takes an in-depth look at the years in which Armstrong was often dismissed as a buffoonish, if popular, entertainer, and shows us instead the inventiveness and depth of expression that his music evinced during this time.<br>&nbsp;<br>These are the years (from after World War II until his death in 1971) when Armstrong entertained crowds around the world and recorded his highest-charting hits, including &#x201c;Mack the Knife&#x201d; and &#x201c;Hello, Dolly!&#x201d;; years when he collaborated with, among others, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, and Dave Brubeck; when he recorded with strings and big bands, and, of course, with the All Stars, his primary recording ensemble for more than two decades. Riccardi makes clear that these were years in which Armstrong both burnished and enhanced his legacy as one of jazz&#x2019;s most influential figures.<br>&nbsp;<br>Eminently readable, informative, and insightful, here, finally, is a book that enlarges and completes our understanding of a peerless musical genius of commanding influence as both an instrumentalist and a vocalist.</p></p><p><p><b>Ricky Riccardi</b> holds a B.A. in journalism and an M.A. in Jazz History and Research from Rutgers University. He has lectured at the Institute of Jazz Studies, at the National Jazz Museum in Harlem, and at the annual Satchmo SummerFest in New Orleans. He is the author of a popular Armstrong blog (dippermouth.blogspot.com) and is himself a jazz pianist. He is the project archivist for the Louis Armstrong House Museum. He lives in New Jersey.</p><p>Introduction<br>&nbsp;<br>A packed theater in Chicago is in attendance to cheer on one of the most beloved musicians in town, Louis Armstrong. Armstrong walks to center stage, a devilish grin on his face; his eyes widen. He picks up his trumpet and begins blowing a tune from a current Broadway show. The audience goes wild at the mere sound of his horn. Armstrong creates a dazzling solo on the popular song, eliciting shouts from the crowd each time he hits a high note. As he finishes, he launches into a novelty number showcasing his talent as a singer and then transitions to a swinging scat interlude, his eyes closed. As he mugs ever so slightly, the crowd applauds his vocal inventiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Armstrong disappears offstage and returns in tails, a pair of glasses and a funny hat. Impersonating a preacher, he tells some of Bert Williams&#x2019;s finest vaudeville jokes and delivers a satrical monologue, before resuming on his trumpet. The band plays &#x201c;Sugar Foot Stomp&#x201d;&#x2014;a good old one&#x2014;and Armstrong swings out with chorus after chorus of blues playing. When he finishes, he bows and grins, closes his eyes, and unleashes a smile to end all smiles.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Was this 1957, or 1967&#x2014;the latter part of Armstrong&#x2019;s career when he was derided by some as an Uncle Tom? No, the year was 1927. The Broadway number was Noel Coward&#x2019;s &#x201c;Poor Little Rich Girl,&#x201d; one of Armstrong&#x2019;s big features with Erskine Tate&#x2019;s orchestra at the Vendome Theatre. The novelty song he scatted was &#x201c;Heebie Jeebies&#x201d; and the preacher routine harked back to his childhood in New Orleans, where he won applause for impersonations and sermons at the local church. A 1927 review found among Armstrong&#x2019;s personal scrapbooks read, &#x201c;Erskine Tate&#x2019;s orchestra at the Vendome Theatre last week was a &#x2018;wow.&#x2019; Louis Armstrong, who is one of [Heebie Jeebies&#x2019;s] pet writers, led the members of the popular orchestra in a &#x2018;prayer&#x2019; with his cornet. During his &#x2018;offering&#x2019; he wore a high silk hat, frocktail coat and smoked glasses. The fans are still giggling over the act as it was far the most amusing one ever seen here.&#x201d; Such a review was not uncommon for Armstrong: &#x201c;But when Luis [sic] Armstrong sang &#x2018;My Baby Knows How,&#x2019; to Charles Harris, who slipped a wig over his head and played the role of the baby that Luis was singing about, the fans laughed themselves dizzy. The number was the best Tate had offered since Luis &#x2018;preached the Gospel&#x2019; some weeks ago.&#x201d; Yet another described him with admiration: &#x201c;This talented musician plays, sings and dances.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Louis Armstrong won audiences over with showmanship, laughter, and sublime music, starting as early as 1927. It is the Armstrong of that year who is usually made out to be the serious artist, celebrated for the groundbreaking Hot Five and Hot Seven&#x2014;recordings that announced the singularity of jazz as a true American art form. So it was no surprise that Christopher Porterfi eld&#x2019;s 2006 <i>Time </i>magazine review of Armstrong&#x2019;s 1920s work exclaimed &#x201c;Forget the Satchmo who sang and mugged his way through his later decades, wonderfully entertaining as he was. This is Armstrong the force of nature&#x2014;exuberant, inspired, irresistible.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>The truth is, Louis Armstrong was a force of nature from the time he fi rst picked up his horn as a teenager until the day he died in 1971. Yet the myth of the &#x201c;two Armstongs&#x201d; continues: the young serious artist and the old entertainer. In fact, Armstrong had always been a master showman. Every aspect of his character, including love of entertaining, was formed during his childhood in New Orleans, singing and scatting in a vocal quartet before even learning to play the cornet. When he joined the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra in New York in 1924, Henderson only grudgingly allowed Armstrong&#x2019;s Bert Williams vaudeville routines on stage, fearing it was too rough around the edges for the predominantly upscale audience. This rankled Armstrong for years: &#x201c;Yeah, but Fletcher didn&#x2019;t dig me like Joe Oliver,&#x201d; Armstrong recalled in a 1960 interview. &#x201c;He had a million-dollar talent in his band and he never thought enough to let me sing or nothing. He&#x2019;d go hire a singer, that lived up in Harlem, that night for the recording the next day, who didn&#x2019;t even know the song. And I&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;Well, let me sing.&#x2019; &#x2018;Nooo, NOOOO!&#x2019; All he had was the trumpet in mind. And that&#x2019;s where he missed the boat. In those days, all Fletcher had to do was keep in his band the things that I&#x2019;m doing now.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Even at age twenty-four, Armstrong was confident of his &#x201c;million-dollar talent&#x201d; to sing and entertain as well as play the trumpet. When he joined Erskine Tate&#x2019;s symphony orchestra in Chicago in 1925, Armstrong&#x2019;s popularity skyrocketed, leading to the vaunted Hot Five recordings for the Okeh label. The Hot Fives and the later Hot Sevens brim with funny bits, though the humorous songs are usually given short shrift.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>This dismissal of Armstrong&#x2019;s later years can be traced back to Gunther Schuller&#x2019;s 1967 work <i>Early Jazz</i>, which systematically solidified the jazz canon of the 1920s. With a background in classical music, Schuller had no patience for Armstrong&#x2019;s comedic tendencies and instead focused chiefly on his trumpet playing. Subsequent jazz histories followed Schuller&#x2019;s lead, rightfully praising tunes like &#x201c;West End Blues&#x201d; and &#x201c;Potato Head Blues,&#x201d; but at the expense of less serious works such as &#x201c;Irish Black Bottom&#x201d; or &#x201c;That&#x2019;s When I&#x2019;ll Come Back to You.&#x201d; Twenty years later, Schuller followed <i>Early Jazz </i>with <i>The Swing Era</i>, in which he continued to praise Armstrong&#x2019;s trumpet playing, but grew increasingly weary of his showmanship. By the time he addressed Armstrong&#x2019;s later years, Schuller was despondent. &#x201c;But the end was not what it should have been,&#x201d; He wrote before suggesting that &#x201c;as America&#x2019;s unofficial ambassador to the world, this country should have provided him an honorary pension to live out his life in dignity, performing as and when he might, but without the need to scratch out a living as a good- natured buffoon, singing &#x2018;Blueberry Hill&#x2019; and &#x2018;What a Wonderful World&#x2019; night after night.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Schuller was wrong. Armstrong didn&#x2019;t resent singing &#x201c;Blueberry Hill&#x201d; every night. When asked in 1968 what single record he would take to a desert island, Armstrong responded, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to take &#x2018;Blueberry Hill,&#x2019; &#x2018;cause right now, it&#x2019;s like &#x2018;The Star- Spangled Banner&#x2019; in America when I sing it.&#x201d; While Armstrong&#x2019;s trumpet playing may have grown less exhibitionistic over the years, his singing, swinging, mugging, clowning, and playing the hell out of his horn were the same in 1955 as they were in 1925.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>In a 1956 interview Armstrong discussed his longtime drummer Sid Catlett, but might subconsciously have been talking about himself. &#x201c;Take a man like Sid,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He never did get his just praise like he should. He would get a write-up, sometime they&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;Well, he&#x2019;s more showman now&#x2019;&#x2014;showmanship and blah blah. But they ain&#x2019;t figuring out them notes are comin&#x2019; out the horn. And if you stand up there and play and don&#x2019;t smile or something or show that you&#x2019;re relaxing, then they call you a deadpan or&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Armstrong knew he was damned if he did and damned if he didn&#x2019;t. In the late sixties, when riding the wave of &#x201c;Hello, Dolly!,&#x201d; Armstrong was asked about the critics of his style of performing. &#x201c;Aw, I am paid to <i>entertain </i>the people,&#x201d; Armstrong responded. &#x201c;If they want me to come on all strutty and cutting up&#x2014;if that makes &#x2019;em happy, why not?&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Some writers accused Armstrong of coasting in his later years, relying on the same songs every night, mugging excessively, not really playing the horn as he once did. Nothing could be farther from the truth. As Dan Morgenstern has said, this period was in fact the most taxing of Armstrong&#x2019;s career:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br><i>He&#x2019;s out there all the time. He is the master of ceremonies. He is the lead singer. He is the lead player. He&#x2019;s there on everything. He will be sure to close those ensembles with something that demands a little bit in the way of chops and he&#x2019;s there from beginning to end. So that happens at a time in his career when he&#x2019;s already, you know, this is . . . what, 1947? So he&#x2019;s already in his late forties. This is a time when . . . a brass player of his range and using the kind of, not a non-pressure system but the kind of embouchure and technique that he has, which is very taxing.

A noted architectural historian, Gray has also written columns for <i>Avenue</i> and <i>House &amp; Garden</i> magazines and has authored four books on New York City's architecture. Suzanne Braley studied urban planning and business at the University of Michigan, and historic preservation at Columbia University, New York.Having once been called a "building genealogist" by a stranger, Gray is definitely something more than an architectural historian. His "Streetscapes" column for the New York Times has taken readers through the architectural history of Gotham for 15 years, and now his book will make that journey comprehensive and just as immediate. Winding from lower Manhattan to uptown, the vignettes present an image of a structure-sometimes a garden or viaduct or something besides a building-with a revealing short text. More than 300 black-and-white (often period) photographs depict the lavish and strange interiors and exteriors of the structures. The combination of Gray's elegant architectural writing (on MoMA's facade: "After that the curved canopy was replaced and the panels were either all replaced or altered to eliminate their variegated, milky quality") with his gossipy and historical anecdotes ("In 1893 Delmonico's was found guilty of serving woodcock out of season") makes this an indispensable book for New York and architecture enthusiasts. Gray does a service for a place where, as he writes, "information is lost to local memory far sooner than in a suburban or rural environment." New York becomes a four-dimensional object with his revelations, a layered thing that can be peeled and examined in time and space. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I&#39;ve Got You Under My Skin: A Novel (1)</h2><p>In this suspenseful novel from the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Mary Higgins Clark, a Manhattan ER doctor is brazenly murdered in front of his young son in a city playground.

Fans of Mark Kurlansky&#x2019;s <em>Cod</em> and <em>The Big Oyster</em> or Trevor Corson&#x2019;s <em>The Secret Life of Lobsters</em> will love Prosek&#x2019;s probing exploration of the hidden deep-water dwellers. With characteristically captivating prose and lavish illustrations, Prosek demystifies the eel&#x2019;s unique biology and bizarre mating routines, and illuminates the animal&#x2019;s varied roles in the folklore, cuisine, and commerce of a variety of cultures. </p></p><p><p> They are the only fish that spawn in the middle of the ocean but spend their adult lives in freshwater. They can overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and even cross over land. They are revered as guardians and monster-seducers by New Zealand&#x2019;s Maori and have inspired origin myths throughout the Pacific Islands. Often viewed with disgust in the West, they are a multibillion-dollar business in the Asian food market. And they are often mistaken for snakes. They are eels&#x2014;one of the world&#x2019;smost amazing and least understood fish. (Yes, fish.) </p><p> James Prosek offers a fascinating tour through the life history and cultural associations of the freshwater eel, exploring its biology in streams and epic migrations in the ocean, its myth and lore, its mystery and beauty. Prosek travels the globe to tell the story of the eel&#x2014;from New York to New Zealand; from Europe to Japan and the small island of Pohnpei in Micronesia, where freshwater eels are worshipped by members of the eel clan. Along the way he introduces individuals whose lives are most connected with the eels&#x2019; story&#x2014;including fishermen, conservationists, and scientists seeking to uncover the eels&#x2019; elusive home in the Sargasso Sea and their spawning places in other oceans of the world. Though freshwater eels have been here for hundreds of millions of years, populations are rapidly declining, due largely to dams, overfishing, pollution, and perhaps even global climate change. </p><p> Illustrated with original etchings by the author, <em>Eels</em> is a mesmerizing biography and history of this intriguing and mysterious creature. It is also a telling look at humanity, the will to persist, and the ever-changing relationship between man and the natural world.</p><p>James Prosek is a writer and artist. Dubbed &#x201c;the Audubon of the fishing world&#x201d; by the <em>New York Times</em>, his books include <em>Trout</em>, <em>The Complete Angler</em>, and <em>Fly-Fishing the 41st</em>.

They have two, very cool, adult daughters, Rachael and Tegan, and two delightful grandkids. As a family they enjoy spending time at their lake cabin in northern Minnesota. Roxanne has a degree in Behavioral and Social Science from the University of Mary and for many years was a newspaper humor columnist. She has also written and recorded radio commercials, written for, and performed in, a comedy duo; and co-written school lyceums. Roxy is currently a columnist for ND Living magazine. She is the author of eight novels. You can contact her at: roxannehenke@yahoo.comIn this debut inspirational novel about the faith and friendship of two smalltown North Dakota women, fresh writing gives a familiar plot new life. Olivia Marsden is a columnist for the Brewster Banner, but secretly longs to write a novel (which the prologue hints that this book becomes). She's not good at relationships, but when perky Anne Abbot moves to town, the two form a tight-knit friendship. However, their joy about Anne's first pregnancy soon becomes fear when Anne is diagnosed with breast cancer. As Olivia spends more and more time helping Anne, her own family slides into chaos in her absence. Suddenly, in a jarring transition for the reader, Olivia drops her friendship with Anne. In confusion over her life, Olivia turns to Oprah Winfrey's television program for guidance, which rather improbably helps Olivia figure out her past. When she realizes her faults, Olivia makes amends with Anne, but Anne's cancer is back, and the end looms near. The novel is told in alternating chapters of first-person narrative from Anne and Olivia, which makes it a bit lengthy and occasionally repetitious. Readers may also have a sense of d&#x201a;j... vu if they've read Jamie Langston Turner's excellent Some Wildflower in My Heart, which has startling similarities in plot and characterization. But the author's voice is distinctly her own, and although Anne's eventual death is telegraphed from the first page, Henke's poignant writing will still make even the most jaded readers reach for the Kleenex. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Tarot of Perfection: A Book of Tarot Tales</h2><p>A collection of wildly vivid tales of tarot, divination, imagination and desire from an award-winning author of fantasy.

She holds an honours degree in English from New York University, a Masters in English from Claremont Graduate School and has taught English at New York State University.A perfect, powerful deck of tarot cards weaves through this slightly haphazard assortment of eight fables from World Fantasy Award&#x2013;winner Pollack (<i>Unquenchable Fire</i>). The underwhelming title story sets the stage for tales that run the gamut from charming to disturbing and alternate rhythmically between modern magical realism and surreal high fantasy. Pollack's fairy tales are the strongest pieces: The Fool, the Stick, and the Princess details the virtues of eschewing skepticism for happiness, while Carolina in the Morning is a grim but uplifting parable of domestic abuse and the persistence of children. The powerful final story, Master Matyas, reveals information that ties earlier pieces together. This collection is probably most meaningful to those with a strong background in fortune telling, but enough stories stand alone to entertain an amateur tarot enthusiast. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Almost every day, newspaper headlines and media commentators scream warnings of impending doom--shortages of arable land, clashes over water, and political conflict as global demand for fossil fuels outstrips supply. The picture is bleak, but our grasp of the details and the macro shifts in commodities markets remain blurry.<p><i>Winner Take All</i> is about the commodity dynamics that the world will face over the next several decades. In particular, it is about the implications of China's rush for resources across all regions of the world. The scale of China's resource campaign for hard commodities (metals and minerals) and soft commodities (timber and food) is among the largest in history. To be sure, China is not the first country to launch a global crusade to secure resources. From Britain's transcontinental operations dating back to the end of the 16th century, to the rise of modern European and American transnational corporations between the mid 1860's and 1870's, the industrial revolution that powered these economies created a voracious demand for raw materials and created the need to go far beyond their native countries.</p><p>So too is China's resource rush today. Although still in its early stages, already the breadth of China's operation is awesome, and seemingly unstoppable. China's global charge for commodities is a story of China's quest to secure its claims on resource assets, and to guarantee the flow of inputs needed to continue to drive economic development. Moyo, an expert in global commodities markets, explains the implications of China's resource grab in a world of diminishing resources.</p></p><p>An international economist and one of the world's leading experts on macroeconomics and global affairs, in 2009 Moyo was named by Time as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World,&#x201d; and was named to the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders Forum. Her writing regularly appears in economic and finance-related publications such as the Financial Times, the Economist, and the Wall Street Journal. In September 2009 Moyo was featured on Oprah Winfrey's Power List&#x201d; of twenty remarkable visionaries. She has appeared as a guest CNN, CNBC, BBC, and Fox Business. She has done numerous speaking engagements at organizations including OECD, World Bank, IMF, Council on Foreign Relations, and the American Enterprise Institute. In 2009 she spoke at the TEDx conference at the EU Parliament. She holds a PhD in economics from Oxford and an MPA from Harvard. She lives in New York and London.<br><br>With Winner Take All, Dambisa Moyo offers a timely and provocative answer to two crucial questions: How are China's leaders rushing to meet their country's exploding demand for energy, and what does this mean for the rest of us? From Africa to Central Asia to Latin America, China exerts growing influence over prices for the commodities we all must buy to fuel our cars, heat our homes, and power our economies. It's a recipe for conflict and at a crucial moment for the future of the global economy.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Business Insider</i></b> If Moyo's calculations are correct, we are in big trouble which makes the central premise of her book, Winner Take All, all the more arresting. . . .

Its effect was to transform the modest tinted drawing of the topographer into a powerful and highly flexible means of expression for some of the Romantic era's greatest artists, among them Thomas Girtin, J.M.W. Turner and John Constable. The painters of the next generation were no less ambitious, and the range of subject-matter and technical inventiveness that was sustained for much of the Victorian period was to set a standard in watercolour painting that was without equal abroad.<br>In this magnificently illustrated survey of the great age of British watercolours, Andrew Wilton and Anne Lyles trace the development of attitudes to landscape and to the human figure in the landscape from 1750 to 1880. They show how once the traditional pen and ink drawing and its augmented washes of colour had been abandoned in order to paint directly in watercolours without pen outlines, the way was open for the powerful Romantic landscapes of the following decade and beyond, many of which were painted in the wild mountainous regions of Wales and Scotland.<br>During the nineteenth century, as the gilt-framed exhibition watercolour began to challenge the long-established oil painting in terms of size and in brilliance of colour and effect, the range of subject-matter was broadened to include scenes of country and town life from every part of Britain and, increasingly, from the Continent too. By mid-century the Near East was attracting many of the greatest Victorian watercolourists, including J. E. Lewis, David Roberts and Edward Lear. Other leading Victorians who regularly worked in watercolour include the Pre-Raphaelite painters John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt, and the American-born James McNeill Whistler, all of whom are included in this book.</p><p>The ambitious subject matter, versatile brushwork and daring conceptions of watercolorists William Blake, Thomas Rowlandson, J.M.W. Turner, Samuel Palmer, David Cox, James Whistler and 81 other artists enliven this magificient album. It catalogues an exhibition that opened at London's Royal Academy and soon moves to the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. The standing stones seem to dance in John Constable's Stonehenge. One can find precursors of impressionism, expressionism, surrealism and abstraction among the 320 color plates and 60 black-and-white reproductions which, taken as a whole, alter one's view of British watercolor. Art historians Wilton and Lyles, both with London's Tate Gallery, ably trace the intellectual cross-currents of a peculiarly English movement that marked an unshackling of the imagination, a shift from observation to expression. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Man Called Peter: The Story of Peter Marshall</h2><p>In the Preface to A Man Called Peter, Catherine Marshall tells of a dream she had after Peter Marshall's death: Peter was working in a rose garden and said playfully, "I know perfectly well what you've been doing, Catherine.

On the heels of Dear Mili comes this slim anthology of his essays and musings on writing and illustrating for children. It reveals a formidable intelligence, and a remarkable degree of empathy with fellow toilers in what is too often regarded as a somewhat lesser field of endeavor: as if writing and drawing for children were a distinctly second-best activity. Without being weighty about it, Sendak shows the degree of imagination, craft and humanity that goes into the best of this work. There are notably generous appreciations of well-known artists like Randolph Caldecott, Beatrix Potter and Jean de Brunhoff, and sharp-eyed essays on Andersen, the "Mother Goose" tradition and the best and worst of Walt Disney. There are also more ephemeral pieces like award acceptances, interviews and brief prefaces to booksthough almost none is without some worthwhile observation. What comes through above all is Sendak's open-hearted admiration for craft and respect for true, ageless imagination. Illustrations not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Sendak's first collection of critical writings has a dual focus. It offers commentary on children's books and their illustration by a knowledgeable, working artist and, in an autobiographical second section that suggests Sendak's development and philosophy, helps us understand the author's own work. Among the illustrators and writers Sendak extols are Randolph Caldecott, George MacDonald, Beatrix Potter, Winsor McCay, Edward Ardizzone, and a handful of contemporary practitioners. Sendak's criticism, whether essay-length or just a few paragraphs, is infused with personal feeling as well as professional judgment and a sound historical sense, and his own contributions to the art of the children's book animates his "appreciations" of others'.

Under the expert leadership of Danny O. Coulson, these highly trained agents of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team execute perilous missions in crises too volatile for SWAT teams, and in explosive situations where there are.... <b><i>No Heroes</i></b> Danny O. Coulson is the founder of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hostage Rescue Team, or HRT. In an FBI career that spans three decades, he led the arrest of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, convinced McVeigh's friend Michael Fortier to become the government's star witness, and has helped bring hundreds of murderous extremists and killers to justice -- from the Black Liberation Army police assassins to the treacherous white supremacist terrorists of the Order, and the Covenant, Sword and Arm of the Lord. In <i>No Heroes,</i> Coulson opens a long-locked door into the secretive world of the HRT, the civilian equivalent of the U.S. military's elite Delta Force. Coulson's stories spring to life with nerve-jangling electricity as he discloses the tactics and teamwork of HRT snipers, operators, negotiators, and experts in assaults, electronics and explosives. Coulson takes the reader inside famous cases and provides riveting first person accounts of such high-profile investigations as the Atlanta prison riots -- and tense showdowns including the disastrous sieges at Ruby Ridge and Waco. He sheds new light on the deadliest terrorist attack in American history -- the Oklahoma City bombing that took 168 lives -- with never-before-revealed details of the FBI's massive efforts to locate the conspirators before they struck again. Finally, Coulson exposes the frightening rise of domestic terrorism and its implications for the 21st Century. For him and the men and women who have followed him, the path to justice is never too steep, too dark or too narrow. Though equipped with high tech weapons and physically fit bodies, these agents consider their razor sharp minds to be their best weapons. They use deadly force only in defense of life. Because, when people die, there are <i>No Heroes.</i></p><p><b>Danny O. Coulson,</b> a Texas native, served with the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1966 until 1997, and was the first commander of the bureau's Hostage Rescue Team.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Back around 1964, when I was in my first year at Southern Methodist University Law School, I got this idea that I could make a difference. Maybe it was my take on sixties idealism or maybe it was four generations of cowboys and stockmen peering down at me. Or maybe it was all those Saturday matinees at the Fort Worth picture show, gazing up at the silvery profiles of Randolph Scott, Henry Fonda, and John Wayne. Mom and Pop thought the law would set me on the path of fame and fortune, but I knew I couldn't settle into a slick Dallas law firm, prop a pair of $500 boots on a desk the size of a pool table and help chiselers carve up ranch land into housing developments or handle divorces for spoiled rich people. The world was made up of good guys and bad guys. I was going to be one of the good guys. </p><p> Exactly how I was going to get into the saving-the-world business was not entirely clear to me at the time. I'd solve that problem when I came to it. In the meantime, I figured I'd prepare for the task ahead by poking around in the dark corners of the human condition. I had almost no idea what I was looking for. I'd grown up in a modest, tidy, little house in a neat, little neighborhood. I hadn't had much in the way of toys and things, but I'd had something kids don't have now. Freedom. Weekend mornings, I took off on my bike, looking for a few pals to play sandlot ball or go fishing. My mother waved goodbye and called after me, "Be home for supper." What parent today, rich or poor, would let their kids roam around town till twilight? </p><p> By the time I got to law school, though, I had a sense of the dark side, and something drove me to find out more. I tried to explain my idea to Pop in the spring of '64, when we were out for a twilight ride on Uncle Will's place outside Hamilton, Texas. Pop was lounging in his saddle, smoking a cigarette with one leg draped over the horn, listening to the crickets and gazing at the setting sun. Young hotshot that I was I couldn't bear to let him enjoy the peace of the moment. </p><p> "You won't believe where I went last week, Pop," I said cheerfully. "The American Nazi Party had a rally in Dallas. Some guy talked about all the problems in the country and blamed the Jews, blacks, and every minority. I guess you and I are okay. He didn't mention the Irish or the Scots." </p><p> Pop sat bolt upright so fast he nearly spooked his horse, and mine too. It was as if a bolt of lightning had shot from his head right through his body and into his saddle. That old paint wheeled a couple of times before Pop got him under control. <i>Morris is real pissed,</i> I said to myself with satisfaction. <i>A lot of people have learned the hard way, don't piss off Morris.</i> </p><p> "Why would you go see those crazy sons of bitches?" He glowered. "What are you doing, going to something like that?" </p><p> "I don't support what they believe in," I replied earnestly. "I wanted to hear what they had to say. It's important to understand them, and I don't know much about them. Hell, they almost took over the world." </p><p> "Yes, I know," Dad said, spitting out his words. "They almost killed me doing it. There's not a lot you have to know about those assholes. They are <i>evil."</i> </p><p> "Pop, I know they're evil, but you have to understand what's evil so you can deal with it. Knowing what's evil helps you to understand what's good and how to protect it." </p><p> "I reckon you're about half a bubble off plumb," Pop said with resignation. Morris O'Neal Coulson had seen more than he wanted of Nazis when he followed General George Patton across Europe, lugging a Browning automatic rifle that was probably bigger than he was. But he let the matter drop. I guess he thought I was going through a phase. </p><p> However, as I looked toward graduation in 1966, I announced that I intended to become a Navy fighter pilot, the nearest thing the twentieth century could produce in the way of a knight in shining armor. Also, driving F-14s was bound to be a lot more fun than the rodeos where I had risked my scrawny teenage neck. In my dreams, I rammed the dawn sky at Mach one, dived like an osprey, and deftly hitched the tailhook of my Skyhawk onto the slender cable strung across the deck of the aircraft carrier that I called home. </p><p> I was exactly the kind of young man the Navy wanted, the local recruiter assured me. I was destined for the elite judge Advocate General Corps. The Navy had enough pilots. It needed lawyers to whip its young salts into line. </p><p> While brooding over this dispiriting news, I wandered into an antique-gun store, where I met the man who changed my life -- FBI special agent Charley Brown. Charley and I struck up a conversation. He was investigating a theft of some valuable old firearms from New Mexico. That sounded like fun to me. As he went on about all the bank robbers and kidnappers he had run to ground, it occurred to me that the FBI was a ticket to good-guy land. I would get a badge, a gun, $185 a week basic pay, plus all the soaring triumphs and mortal terror that I'd hoped to enjoy as an air warrior. </p><p> The only hitch was, I had to ease the Bureau recruiters' minds about Mama's uncles. One day Kyle Clark, the ASAC -- assistant special agent in charge -- of the Dallas office called to inquire, "Do you associate with any of your grandfather Donald's half brothers?" </p><p> "No," I said, "I think I only saw them one time and I don't even know their names." </p><p> "Good thing. One of them served time at Leavenworth on stolen-car charges." </p><p> "Oh, no," I groaned. "No one in the family really knows them. Is that going to hurt my chances?" </p><p> "Dunno, son," Clark said. </p><p> I stewed for a while until Clark called with good news. "Well, you're in. They decided to take you in spite of your relatives." And also in spite of the fact that I looked more like the typical tunnel rat than the six-foot-three, blond poster boys beloved by J. Edgar Hoover. </p><p> I was so enamored with the vision of myself as a gangbuster that I very nearly skipped the Texas bar exam and drove to Mexico. Only none of my classmates would go with me. Also, Pop got on my back about taking the damn test because you never know, you might need that credential. So I took it and I passed. As much as I hated the idea of lawyers, it seemed that I had a knack for the subject. </p><p> Mama sat there in stunned silence when I started packing up for the FBI Academy. Frances Mavinee Donald Coulson was the daughter of farmers and the wife of a cowboy. She didn't want her only son to grow up to be a cowboy, and as far as she was concerned, an FBI agent was just a cowboy in a suit. Besides, she couldn't imagine why anybody would ever want to leave Texas. She actually stopped speaking to me. Except for rare, brief moments of reconciliation, she didn't relent until she was on her deathbed twenty years later. </p><p> Pop made a halfhearted effort to back her up. "I can't believe you spent seven years in college to be a college cop," he grumbled. But the twinkle in his eyes gave him away. That song about seeing Paree was right on the money. Pop didn't talk about the war much. He had been assigned to a field hospital for a while, and I expect the memories were too awful to dredge up. He did, however, like to boast about the time he wangled a few days' leave in Paris. He had paid for beer by selling surplus cargo parachutes to the ladies of the night, who dyed them black and fashioned them into silk dresses. The war taught Pop a lot of things, among them, that Texas wasn't the hub of the universe. He never said so, but I think that's why he secretly encouraged me to chase my dreams wherever they led. Mama never forgave him either. </p><p><br> In 1967, after a rookie stint in New London, Connecticut, I was assigned to the big New York field office. I was pumped. The Big Apple had it all -- Mafia dons, Wall Street con men, dope kingpins, Tammany Hall grafters and grifters, Most Wanted poster boys. </p><p> Only I wasn't destined to get a chance to go after any of them. Instead, I landed on an internal-security squad whose sole task was keeping tabs on a bunch of elderly people who lived in the Bronx and who belonged to a social club with Communist ties. Squad supervisor John Dooley solemnly informed me that the director wanted to know where every Red in New York was at every moment so that when we went to war with the Soviet Union, we could round up these old folks and intern them as subversives. Upon reviewing the case files Dooley deposited upon my desk, I discovered that fully a third of these people had long been employed as FBI informants. I almost laughed out loud, only as far as I could tell, Dooley, who stood five feet ten inches tall, weighed well over two hundred pounds, and sported the great shock of white hair favored by Hoover-era managers, didn't have much of a sense of humor. </p><p> The squad's old-timers hunched over their desks from nine to five, verifying their targets' residences and vacation plans by making pretext phone calls, posing as magazine salesmen or travel agents. I was twenty six, a lousy liar, and restless as a puppy, so I decided to conduct my investigations in person. My first task was to verify the address of a club member whom I'll call Sadie Grotz. I caught the subway that dropped me off near her apartment building in the Bronx. As I was wandering around looking for the super, a neatly dressed woman in her mid-seventies decided I looked lost and offered to help me. "Do you know Sadie Grotz?" I ventured. </p><p> "Of course, I know Sadie Grotz," she said. "I'm Sadie Grotz. What can I do for you?" </p><p> Flustered, I blurted out, "I'm with the FBI." </p><p> She gave me a big smile and stuck out her hand. "Well, I'm really glad to meet somebody from the FBI. I always believed that after all my years with the Communist Party that somebody from the FBI would come and talk to me." </p><p> She invited me in to her apartment and fixed me a cup of tea and cookies. She said she was loyal to the United States and looked upon her membership in the local Communist Party as a social club where she saw friends from the days when she was active in the trade union movement back in the 1920s and 1930s. We had a nice discussion. I finished up the last of the cookies, returned to the office and reported to Dooley. </p><p> When I joked that I had just had tea and cookies with Sadie Grotz, the Red Menace, Dooley turned beet red and started trembling. I thought he was having a heart attack. </p><p> "Your contact with Mrs. Grotz can have very serious consequences for your career," he sputtered. "It may cost you your job. You have to have Bureau permission to talk to a member of the Communist Party. Don't tell anyone what you've done. Go home and pray that Mrs. Grotz doesn't call the office and ask to see you again." </p><p> <i>Mama, you were right,</i> I thought ruefully. <i>I work for a bunch of crazy people.</i> However, I'd inherited Mama's stubborn genes and Pop's too, so I pestered Dooley with questions and wisecracks until he banished me to the motorcycle surveillance team, which specialized in tailing suspected spies, bank robbers, and organized crime figures through heavy Manhattan traffic. </p><p> I'd never spent much time on a motorcycle before, but after a few sessions with an instructor who thought he was Chuck Yeager on rubber, I discovered that my 500cc BMW was almost as good as a jet fighter and used a lot less gas. I jumped curbs, screamed down sidewalks, slid sideways down alleys, and tore through parks. Steve McQueen's film <i>Bullitt,</i> with Jacqueline Bisset and that great chase scene, came out about that time. My buddies and I were sure that McQueen was imitating us. Once, while chasing a bank robber, I jumped a traffic light, zipped between lanes of traffic, pulled slightly to the front of his Cadillac, and dropped the motorcycle underneath his left front tire. I lunged for his door, yanked him out of the car, and was advising him of his rights while he was still peering down at his fender, looking for the crushed body of the fool who had fallen under his headlights. </p><p> The most senior managers of the field office decided I wasn't cut out to handle the subtleties of counterespionage, white collar crime, or even organized crime work. That left the fugitive squad, the office's dirtiest, least desirable job. In other words they threw me in the brier patch. I couldn't believe my luck. </p><p> Only the fittest -- the quickest, strongest, nastiest, shrewdest, most corrupt -- survived the mean streets of Harlem, Brooklyn, and the South Bronx, and I got paid to catch them. Night after night, I tested myself physically and intellectually against men capable of <i>anything.</i> </p><p> I rationalized that the high I felt came from doing the Lord's work, dragging killers and bloodsuckers out of the neighborhoods, making life a little easier for the shop owners, the old people, and the kids. But, God help me, I loved it. I lived for that high when we actually put our hands on someone who thought he was invisible. </p><p> The only part that bothered me was seeing the kids. When the night was done, I went back to the apartment at Eighteenth and C where I lived with Carol, an Eastern Airlines flight attendant instructor I had recently married. I stashed my reeking hiking boots in the kitchen near the front door, stood under the shower till the hot ran out, and fell into nice cool sheets. Those kids with their hungry eyes, peeping out into the hallways as we hustled by with some sweating, cursing guy in tow, they were trapped in the stench and the noise. </p><p> I thought I knew what poor meant, but I realized I didn't, not until I saw the New York projects. Men congregated on corners or wandered through the buildings from time to time, but they were just visiting. Women, many scarcely more than children themselves, raised their children in chaotic isolation. As a teenager, I'd worked with plenty of guys, black and white, who never had two nickels to rub together after they paid the grocery store and the rent man. But they went home to their families every night, and on Sundays they piled everybody in the truck for a visit to grandma. In New York, I don't know if I ever saw an apartment in which a couple and their children said grace over the dinner table together. </p><p> There was something about the curious little boys who edged up to get a better look at the FBI guy that reminded me how much I had missed Pop when he was off in the war. I had been two years old when he left, and I knew him only by the brief V-mails that Mom read me. </p><p> But the emptiness had been filled by other strong, honest men. During the war, Mom and I lived in Wichita Falls with her parents, Raymond and Lunette Donald. My dad's parents, Bernard and Iola Coulson lived across town. Grandpa Bernard dispensed justice with a stern, sure hand. Whenever I got into a fistfight with my cousins Jimmy and Gayle, Bernard stormed out into the yard, grabbed all of us under his arms, and hung us on the picket fence by the back of our belts. His horses, attracted by the ruckus, drifted up from the back lot and nibbled our jeans as we wriggled, trying to free ourselves. You don't hang on a fence very long before your legs go to sleep, and you start screaming to be released. At that, Bernard stalked out an...</p></p><h2>Informed Heart: Autonomy in a Mass Age</h2><p>A psychoanalysis discussing the purpose and meaning of life in the mid20th century</p><p></p><h2>All Aboard! for Glacier: The Great Northern Railway and Glacier National Park</h2><p>Glacier National Park and the Great Northern Railway became synonymous in the early 20th century.

Same day shipping from AZ</p><p>In the summer of 1914, Sir Ernest Shackleton set off aboard the <i>Endurance</i> bound for the South Atlantic. The goal of his expedition was to cross the Antarctic overland, but more than a year later, and still half a continent away from the intended base, the <i>Endurance</i> was trapped in ice and eventually was crushed. For five months Shackleton and his crew survived on drifting ice packs in one of the most savage regions of the world before they were finally able to set sail again in one of the ship's lifeboats. Alfred Lansing's <i>Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage</i> is a white-knuckle account of this astounding odyssey. <p>Through the diaries of team members and interviews with survivors, Lansing reconstructs the months of terror and hardship the <i>Endurance</i> crew suffered. In October of 1915, there "were no helicopters, no Weasels, no Sno-Cats, no suitable planes. Thus their plight was naked and terrifying in its simplicity. If they were to get out--they had to get themselves out." How Shackleton did indeed get them out without the loss of a single life is at the heart of Lansing's magnificent true-life adventure tale.</p>'A superb account of the greatest survival story of our time' - Chris Bonington The story of Ernest Shackleton's epic journey to cross the Antarctic overland has now been turned into four hours of gripping television with Kenneth Branagh playing Shackleton. <p>Shackleton's mission failed, but the resulting adventure became one of the most celebrated accounts of man's survival against unbelievable odds. </p><p>In August 1914 the Endurance set sail for the South Atlantic. In October 1915, still half a continent away from their objective, the ship was trapped, then crushed in the ice. Twelve hundred miles away from land, drifting on ice packs, Shackleton and his men survived the next five months on a diet of dogs, penguins and seals. When the ship eventually sank they were forced to escape by lifeboat. Shackleton then travelled another 850 miles in an open boat across the stormiest ocean in the world to reach help. Every single man got home safely. </p><p>Miraculously, throughout this ordeal, the expedition's photographer, Frank Hurley, protected his negatives and photographs from destruction. It is these extraordinary photographs that are among those produced in this illustrated edition of Alfred Lansing's harrowing and inspiring classic.</p></p><h2>The Evidential Argument from Evil (Philosophy of Religion)</h2><p><p>Is evil evidence against the existence of God? Even if God and evil are compatible, it remains hotly contested whether evil renders belief in God unreasonable. The Evidential Argument from Evil presents five classic statements on this issue by eminent philosophers and theologians and places them in dialogue with eleven original essays reflecting new thinking by these and other scholars. The volume focuses on two versions of the argument. The first affirms that there is no reason for God to permit either certain specific horrors or the variety and profusion of undeserved suffering. The second asserts that pleasure and pain, given their biological role, are better explained by hypotheses other than theism.</p><p>Contributors include William P. Alston, Paul Draper, Richard M.

Although there were many 'professional' artists working in the early and developing American society from the 17th to the 19th centuries, most of them, apart from the many charming naive practitioners, were itinerant portrait painters or those who looked to Europe for their style and subject matter. It was not until the early 19th century that artists began to consider the landscape which surrounded them as an interesting subject in itself; when they did, they perceived a grandeur, spaciousness and quality of natural beauty which filled them with awe and wonderment.<br>It was this opening of the eyes of their compatriots to their natural heritage that these painters, who have come to be known as the Hudson River School, initiated. Although, in the first instance, it was the area of the Hudson River stretching northwards from New York that first entranced them, as the American continent towards the Rockies unfolded, the artists followed and produced work that revealed a magnificence of scale&#x2014;the great lakes, the towering mountains. deep valleys and gorges of the land in which they found themselves. In this way, although the Hudson River was the first area to exert its influence on these landscapists and gave its name to them, their work spread widely to encompass the whole land. <br>There was also another, transcendental, aspect to their work. they recognized the hand of God in their new environment and accordingly introduced a sense of divine mission into their painting which appealed to the adventurous religious spirit of the early settlers. Through this, their art acquired a new significance which had previously been absent. <br>The story of the artists and their pictorial crusade is included in this selective survey which, of its nature, can only include a small number of the very many who have been identified with the Hudson River School.</p><p></p><h2>Unreal City: Las Vegas, Black Mesa, and the Fate of the West</h2><p>An epic struggle over land, water, and power is erupting in the American West and the halls of Washington, DC. It began when a 4,000-square-mile area of Arizona desert called Black Mesa was divided between the Hopi and Navajo tribes. To the outside world, it was a land struggle between two fractious Indian tribes; to political insiders and energy corporations, it was a divide-and-conquer play for the 21 billion tons of coal beneath Black Mesa. Today, that coal powers cheap electricity for Los Angeles, a new water aqueduct into Phoenix, and the neon dazzle of Las Vegas.<br><br>Journalist and historian Judith Nies has been tracking this story for nearly four decades.

Always a candid and engaging subject, Ginsberg considered the interview an art form, as well as an opportunity to get his message across to many people, which, as a student of Eastern religions, he believed was his spiritual obligation. In these interviews, dating from the late 1950s to the mid-1990s, Ginsberg speaks frankly about his life, his work, and the events of his time.</p><p>Ginsberg's progressive and controversial views on politics and censorship dominate his interviews, from his conversation with the conservative William F. Buckley on PBS to his comments in the <em>Dartmouth Review</em> about U.S. policy in Central America to his testimony at the Chicago Seven trial. Ginsberg discusses his literary influences, including Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Walt Whitman, and William Blake, and offers insights into his own poetry, particularly his innovations in rhythm, meter, and syllable emphasis. A well-known experimenter with drugs, campaigner for their legalization, and believer in their ability to expand consciousness, Ginsberg here describes his LSD trips and his marijuana highs, and explains how they influenced the creation of "Kaddish" and other works. And he talks about his personal life with candor, revealing details of his sexual affairs with fellow Beats Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, and Neal Cassady, and his longtime relationship with Peter Orlovsky.</p><p>Provocative and illuminating, Spontaneous Mind allows us to hear once again the impassioned voice of one of the most influential literary and cultural figures of our time.</p></p><p><p>Allen Ginsberg was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters as well as a winner of the National Book Award for Poetry. He was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1926, and died in New York City in 1997.</p>Ginsberg apparently approached each interviewer "as a future Buddha"; open to any opportunity for conversation, he answered every question, no matter how rude or peculiar. An unpublished 1983 interview here with Steve Foehr consists of one query about the relationship between art and commerce and Ginsberg's seven-page answer ("I simply hung on and tried to get it all written down," says Foehr); others fill only half of a page. The Beat master reiterates that all of his thoughts and expressions emerge from his 1948 auditory hallucination of the voice of William Blake, whose poetic rhythms, childlike innocence, social vision and volatile emotionalism infused Ginsberg's every utterance thereafter. Taken together, these interviews read like an immense jazz oratorio, with rising and falling riffs on prosody, politics, sex, hallucinogens, ecology, jazz, psychoanalysis, Buddhism and his favorite authors Blake, of course, and also Whitman, Pound, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams and Kerouac. Editor Carter, who worked with Ginsberg on one of the first gay cable television shows, provides helpful headnotes for all 30 interviews (culled from some 350), and a "Biographical List" identifies approximately 200 people mentioned in the text. If the 1972 Gay Sunshine interview is the most intimate of these pieces and the excerpt from Ginsberg's testimony in the 1969 Chicago Seven trial the funniest, the strangest entry is surely the 1988 is surely the 1988 Chronicles interview by John Lofton, who wanted "to confront [Ginsberg] with the Truth of God's Word." As Lofton tries to compel the self-described "excitable visionary Jewish Buddhist" to admit the error of his ways, Ginsberg demonstrates his essential sweet nature and his love of verbal Ping-Pong. Carter captures the best of his witty, generous chatter here.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Naming: The First Book of Pellinor (Pellinor Series)</h2><p><b>"An epic fantasy in the Tolkien tradition, with a strong girl hero. . . . I couldn&#x2019;t put it down!" &#x2013; <i>Tamora Pierce</i></b><br><br>Maerad is a slave in a desperate and unforgiving settlement, taken there as a child when her family is destroyed in war. She doesn&#x2019;t yet know she has inherited a powerful gift, one that marks her as a member of the noble School of Pellinor and enables her to see the world as no other can. It is only when she is discovered by Cadvan, one of the great Bards of Lirigon, that her true identity and extraordinary destiny unfold. Now, she and her mysterious teacher must embark on a treacherous, uncertain journey through a time and place where the forces of darkness wield an otherworldly terror. <br><br>The first book in a projected quartet, Alison Croggon&#x2019;s epic about Maerad and her remarkable yet dangerous gift is a beautiful, unforgettable tale. Presented as a new translation of an ancient text, <i>The Naming</i> evokes the rich and complex landscape of Annar, a legendary world just waiting to be discovered.</p><p>Australian poet Alison Croggon brings an eye for sensual detail to this heroic fantasy that follows the genre's familiar formula: A humble person is caught up in extraordinary events and led (or sent) on a journey by a wise figure, only to discover eventually that he/she is destined to save the world in an ultimate confrontation between the powers of good and evil. In this case the young person is sixteen-year-old Maedra, who is rescued from slavery by the Bard Cadvan. They share an exhausting journey toward Innail, one of the Bard schools and strongholds that govern the land, and Maedra grows to trust Cadvan as he reluctantly reveals his magical powers in several ambushes from evil creatures. But under duress she, too, begins to discover that she has a Gift--and more. After she has learned to read, ride a horse, and handle a sword at Innail, they set out on another dangerous trek to the prestigious city of Norloch, where Cadvan hopes to consult with his mentor Nelac to confirm his conviction that Maerad is the One who was Foretold. Many other characters and creatures come into this tale, as well as mystical intimations and dreams, and lavish descriptions of landscape, food, clothes, and room furnishings. In the tradition of Tolkien, a whole history of an ancient language and culture undergirds the story, and Croggon has even provided appendices of that history, a pronunciation guide, and an invented bibliography of her sources. Die-hard fantasy fans who can forgive its slow pace will enjoy this richly imagined story and look forward to its sequel, <i>The Riddle</i>.

This book, written by one of America's leading black historians, sets the record straight. As Benjamin Quarles shows, blacks were anything but passive in the abolitionist movement. Many of the pioneers of abolition were black; dozens of black preachers and writers actively promoted the cause; black organizations were founded to support their brothers; black ambassadors for freedom crossed the Atlantic; blacks were instrumental in the operation of the Underground Railroad. Quarles puts it eloquently: &#x201d;To the extent that America had a revolutionary tradition [the black American] was its protagonist no less than its symbol.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Benjamin Quarles</b> (1904&#x2013;1996) was a noted author, editor, and historian and the first African American to be published in what later became the <i>Journal of American History.

The vast majority of these engaging human figures were created by shipcarvers-highly skilled artists celebrated for their masterful figureheads but who collectively made tens of thousands of shop figures as well, from fanciful representations of American Indians to firemen, baseball players, and fashionable women.</p><br><br><p>Shaped by nineteenth-century Anglo-American values, this artwork reflects the tenor of the times, including racial and gender stereotyping, America's emerging popular culture, and the birth of modern advertising techniques.</p><br><br><p><i>The Shipcarvers' Art</i> is the first book to assess the artistry and history of these two closely related genres in a single volume. Richly illustrated and elegantly written, it reveals the intertwining of art, commerce, and shipcarving in nineteenth-century America. On March 22, 1856, for example, only four months after Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem Hiawatha was first published, the clipper Minehaha was launched at an East Boston shipyard. Its figurehead depicted a renowned English actress in her role as Hiawatha's wife, Minehaha. Central to the festivities surrounding the event were poet, actress, and shipbuilder--and a fictional image of the Native American.</p><br><br><p>Ralph Sessions not only highlights the work of shipcarvers throughout the eastern United States and Canada but also presents new information on carving workshops in New York City, America's key shipbuilding center from around 1820 until after the Civil War.</p><br><br><p>Just as they were vanishing from the bows of ships and city streets around the turn of the twentieth century, figureheads and shop figures began to experience renewed interest as museum pieces and collector's items. Representing a milestone in scholarship on the subject, <i>The Shipcarvers' Art</i> magnificently brings them alive once more for art lovers of the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><p>"Beautifully written, meticulously researched, and well-presented, <i>The Shipcarvers' Art</i> represents a major contribution to our understanding of nineteenth-century American visual culture. There is simply no other book out there that covers this material. It succeeds marvelously at understanding the material on its own terms, and presenting it in the context of American social history. That is a superlative achievement. All scholars of American art history and folk art, as well as collectors, will want this book."<b>--Janet Catherine Berlo, author of <i>The Early Years of Native American Art History</i></b></p><p>"<i>The Shipcarvers' Art</i> will have an important and lasting impact on our understanding of shop figures. Ralph Sessions seeks to elevate the lowly 'Cigar-Store Indian' concept from offensive, maligned cast-off to a transcendent figure representing specific roles of American craftsmen as artisans and as mirrors of eighteenth- and nineteenth- century popular culture. He explores new ground using an intensity not yet visited on this class of folk art. His engaging and approachable writing style coupled with many illustrations make this work available to a wide readership, which will appreciate this detailed look at a rather hidden--very neglected--class of folk art."<b>--David H.

Among much else, they found that the rotting 100-year-old houses were some of the most lucrative properties in the capital for their absent slumlords. Peers of the Realm, local politicians, churchmen and lawyers were making profits on these death-traps of as much as 150 per cent per annum. Before long, Old Nichol became a focus of public attention: its 6,000 inhabitants were condemned for their drunkenness and criminality.

Japanese hand tools, centuries old in concept and design, reflect Japan's perfectionist work ethic and differ from our own methods in a number of basic ways. Among them: Japanese saws for any procedure (e.g., joining mortice and tenon) function on the work-stroke's pull rather than push. Smoothing planes also require the user to pull towards the body. Maintenance of these wood-fashioned tools is an elaborate procedure. There are dozens of "finger planes" for cabinetry's hollows, rounds, tongues and grooves. Even chisels from Japan are distinctive in structure and assembly, and these, along with Japanese measuring and marking devices, knives, hammers and hatchets are intriguing to read about.

They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization, and helped make us who we are.</p><p>William Hazlitt (1778-1830) was a prolific journalist, parliamentary reporter, dramatic and literary critic, essayist and lecturer.

I was determined to see this fight, come what would, and see it I did, in great style. It was my <i>first fight</i>, yet it more than answered my expectations. Ladies - it is to you I dedicate this description; nor let it seem out of character for the fair to notice the exploits of the brave. Courage and modesty are the old English virtues; and may they never look cold and askance on one another! Think, ye fairest of the fair, loveliest of the lovely kind, ye practisers of soft enchantment, how many more ye kill with poisoned baits than ever fell in the ring; and listen with subdued air and without shuddering, to a tale tragic only in appearance, and sacred to the FANCY!</p></p><h2>As We Speak: How to Make Your Point and Have It Stick</h2><p><i>The world is full of brilliant people whose ideas are never heard.

Whether we are speaking to a large audience, within a group, or in a one-on-one conversation, the way in which we communicate ideas, as much as the ideas themselves, can determine success or failure. In this invaluable guide by two of today&#x2019;s most sought-after communication experts, Peter Meyers and Shann Nix offer a comprehensive approach for tackling the underlying obstacles that almost all of us experience when faced with speaking in public. In <i>As We Speak, </i>you&#x2019;ll learn to master the three building blocks at the core of their approach: </p><p><b>Content: </b>Organize the information you want to convey and construct a clear and lucid architecture of ideas that will lead your listener through a memorable emotional experience. </p><p><b>Delivery: </b>Use your body, voice, eyes, and hands in ways that engage your audience and naturally support your message. </p><p><b>State: </b>Bring yourself into peak performance condition. Your state is the way you feel when you perform, and it is both the most powerful and most frequently overlooked component of communication. </p><p>Meyers and Nix show how to apply these principles in a wide variety of situations. You&#x2019;ll learn how to handle difficult face-to-face conversations with colleagues, friends, and family; how to make the best use of e-mail, phone, video conference, and other technology; and how to communicate in a crisis, when all eyes are on you and emotions are running high. Meyers and Nix also emphasize that effective communication is impossible without first becoming aware of your own true goals and personal beliefs, and they offer helpful tools and exercises that will lead you to greater clarity and self-knowledge. </p><p>Accessible, inspiring, and laden with useful tips, <i>As We Speak </i>will help you discover your authentic voice and learn to convey your ideas in the most powerful and memorable way possible.</p></p><p><b>Peter Meyers </b>is the founder of Stand &amp; Deliver Consulting Group.

You&#x2019;re pacing back and forth, thumbing through your notecards. You should have numbered them. You dropped them coming up the stairs, and now they&#x2019;re completely out of order. What does the first slide say? You can&#x2019;t remember. You should have stayed up longer last night. You should have spent more time preparing. Did you choose the right tie? Is the knot straight? You check it again. The suit that looked fine this morning suddenly feels crumpled and too tight. </p><p>Your face feels red and hot. What if you forget what you&#x2019;re going to say? What if they don&#x2019;t like you? What if they ask you tough questions? What if they find out that you&#x2019;re not as smart as they think you are? There are people in that audience who know more about this topic than you do, you&#x2019;re sure of it . . . </p><p>You peek out from behind the heavy red velvet curtain again. There are still people coming in and finding their seats. The people who are seated look bored already, and you haven&#x2019;t said a word yet. You spot your boss in the second row, looking worried. He&#x2019;s got high hopes for you. Just this morning, he told you how much is riding on this presentation. Sitting next to your boss is Brad&#x2014;the guy in the office who&#x2019;s after your job. Brad is leaning back in his chair, arms folded, smirking. He&#x2019;s got a clipboard and a red pen on his lap, ready to take notes and find the holes in your data. He&#x2019;s looking forward to this, you can tell. </p><p>You can see nearly all of your colleagues in the audience. If only it were just a customer meeting, where the worst that could happen was that you would lose the account. But these people know you. You will have to face them tomorrow in the elevator, and every morning after that. Whatever you say out there on that stage, you will have to live with for the next few years. It will be talked about, written about, gossiped about. They&#x2019;re already looking at their watches, pulling out their smartphones, poised to text and tweet the results of your efforts around the globe before you leave the stage. </p><p>You can feel your heart thumping against your ribs. All you can do is pray that your boss won&#x2019;t recognize the look of terror on your face. You can feel the sweat on your upper lip, and you wipe it off. You notice that your hands are trembling. You shove them in your pockets, then pull them out again. </p><p>A sympathetic gray-haired lady introduces you. There is a smattering of applause. You raise your chin, take a deep breath, and walk out onstage. The bright lights hit you like a wall. As you look into the audience, you can feel five hundred sets of eyeballs staring at you. Everything feels surreal, as if you&#x2019;re in a dream. Every nerve in your body is screaming at you to run. Your legs are moving on their own, like some macabre dance step. Why are you here? Why did you ever agree to this? Your hands, despite your best intentions, seem to have wound up in your pockets again. With an effort you pull them out, and grab the podium with white knuckles. Your mouth has gone dry, and you notice, too late, that there is no water glass at the podium. You quickly check the computer screen, and then look up. Your brain is completely blank. You cannot remember your name, much less the first line of your presentation. The silent seconds stretch out like hours. The people in the front row are watching you with an expression that you realize, after a moment, is pity. </p><p>Does this sound like your worst nightmare? If you&#x2019;re terrified by the thought of standing up and speaking in front of a group of people, you&#x2019;re not alone. And there&#x2019;s nothing wrong with you. The problem is that as human beings, <i>we are hardwired to fail</i> in a situation like this. </p><p>Why is that? Well, it&#x2019;s because of two tiny, almond-shaped structures in your brain called the amygdalae. Lodged in the oldest part of the brain, the amygdalae have only one job, and it&#x2019;s not to think&#x2014;it&#x2019;s to keep you alive. The amygdalae never sleep; they are part of an early-warning system that constantly scans for danger and sends an alert to your body anytime you&#x2019;re under threat. And at the moment, standing on that stage, your DNA tells you that you are in serious trouble. Your mammalian brain, sharpened by millions of years of evolution, knows exactly what it means to feel hundreds of eyes staring at you from out of the darkness. It means you&#x2019;re about to be <i>lunch.</i> </p><p>Your amygdalae swing into action. They wrest control away from your evolved higher brain, and pass it back to the primitive part of your brain that specializes in survival. The adrenal glands, sitting just over your kidneys, start to pump adrenaline into your system. You breathe more rapidly, oxygenating the blood. Your heartbeat speeds up, preparing you for exertion. You start to sweat, becoming slippery and harder to grab. Your vision sharpens in preparation for battle or escape. Blood flow is redirected toward the large muscle groups in your arms and legs, to help you fight or run. All noncritical functions shut down. Blood is robbed from any organ not immediately necessary for survival. </p><p>Unfortunately for you right now, one of these nonessentials is your frontal cortex, where language is processed. The words of your carefully prepared presentation leave your head as the blood drains away from your forebrain. You blank your opening. You feel stupid because, at that moment, your IQ has actually dropped. You are in the middle of what is called an <b>amygdala hijack.</b> </p><p>Being smart, successful, beautiful, or talented doesn&#x2019;t protect you from falling prey to an amygdala hijack. In fact, lots of Fortune 500 CEOs, global leaders, diplomats, ambassadors, and political candidates experience the same problem. And when they do, many of them call us. </p><p>Who are we? We&#x2019;re two people who come from the front lines of high-performance communication. Peter Meyers is the founder and director of Stand &amp; Deliver, a company that travels the world to coach CEOs and top executives in the United States, Western Europe, Scandinavia, Russia, Japan, Latin America, and the Middle East. Shann Nix is an award-winning journalist, novelist, playwright, and former radio talk show host on a number one&#x2013;rated radio station, speaking to nearly one million listeners a night. Together we have a combined fifty years of experience working in theater, radio, film, television, fiction, and journalism. </p><p>And what do we do? Well, when a leader steps into the spotlight, all eyes are on him. Whether it&#x2019;s the president of the United States or the president of the local library fund, the expectations when he opens his mouth are daunting. He&#x2019;s supposed to automatically exhibit certain qualities of insight, clarity, and confidence. </p><p>The problem is that being smart doesn&#x2019;t necessarily make someone a good communicator. In fact, the tragedy of many smart people is that their ability to <i>think</i> exceeds their ability to <i>speak.</i> And that&#x2019;s where we come in. </p><p>We are often called into a high-stakes situation twenty-four or forty-eight hours before the event, to avert a potential communication crisis. We&#x2019;ve coached leaders in greenrooms just before they step out onstage, and rewritten speeches through the night before the morning of the presentation. We develop the language and content, put them on their feet, rehearse them, and give them the tools they need to rise to the occasion. </p><p>Sometimes we come in when the leaders of an organization need to win the hearts and minds of their people, to influence a team to step up to a new challenge or align disparate groups so that they&#x2019;re working more collaboratively. </p><p>We are often asked to work with a high-level executive who is intelligent and experienced, but who is undermining her own authority with old habits. We help her translate her ideas into action, and to speak with a level of authority and confidence so that she will finally get the attention she deserves. We might coach the senior vice president who is brilliant at his job, but falls apart when asked to report to the board. We help speakers provide clarity where there is confusion, credibility where there is doubt, and excitement where there is monotony. </p><p>We&#x2019;re brought in to make sure that the thinking gets the expression it deserves: that the quality of the ideas is matched by the vitality of the speaker&#x2019;s presence. We work with smart midlevel people who are getting passed over because they are unable to speak up. We help people who want to communicate better in meetings, who are asking questions like: &#x201c;How do I jump in?&#x201d; &#x201c;How do I fight against the extroverts?&#x201d; &#x201c;How do I hold my own in the room if I&#x2019;m more of a reflective thinker, or a numbers guy?&#x201d; We&#x2019;re often called in to work with financial or analytical people who need to know how to translate data into memorable, compelling narratives. Often we are asked to work with CEOs who are intelligent but emotionally cold, struggling to connect with their people. </p><p>People generally call us for one of two reasons. Either they&#x2019;ve already had some success in communication and, having had a taste of it, want more; or they&#x2019;ve had a painful experience like the one we described in the opening, and don&#x2019;t ever want to suffer like that again. A lot of the people who call us are &#x201c;getting through&#x201d; their presentations, but the process of preparation is filled with dread. They want to stop the panic, and start to enjoy the process and get better results. There are a lot of people out there who are already <i>pretty good</i> communicators. But in the words of Jim Collins, &#x201c;good is the enemy of great.&#x201d; We work with people who are committed to raising their standards. </p><p>If you&#x2019;re reading this book, congratulations.

What lessons can we learn from them?<br><br>These are questions with no quick answers, but perhaps ones that might lead to a shared reckoning worthy of the sacrifices of those&#x2014;troops and civilians alike&#x2014;whose lives have been changed by more than a decade and a half of war.<br><br>Weston takes us from Twentynine Palms in California to Fallujah in Iraq, Khost and Helmand in Afghanistan, Maryland, Colorado, Wyoming, and New York City, as well as to out-of-the-way places in Iowa and Texas. We meet generals, corporals and captains, senators and ambassadors, NATO allies, Iraqi truck drivers, city councils, imams and mullahs, Afghan schoolteachers, madrassa and college students, former Taliban fighters and ex-Guant�namo prison detainees, a torture victim, SEAL and Delta Force teams, and many Marines.<br><br>The overall frame for the book, from which the title is taken, centers on soldiers who have received a grievous wound to the face. There is a moment during their recovery when they must look upon their reconstructed appearance for the first time. This is known as &#x201c;the mirror test.&#x201d; From an intricate tapestry of voices and stories&#x2014;Iraqi, Afghan, and American&#x2014;Weston delivers a larger mirror test for our nation in its global role. An unflinching and deep examination of the interplay between warfare and diplomacy, this is an essential book&#x2014;a crucial look at America now, how it is viewed in the world and how the nation views itself.</p><p><b>JOHN KAEL WESTON</b>&nbsp;represented the United States for more than a decade as a State Department official.

Lucrative contracts were awarded for commercial and charter airlines to fill the gap. Soon Boeing 757s helped transport battalions of Marines and soldiers to Kuwait. From there the Pentagon&#x2019;s workhorse C-130 flown by uniformed pilots&#x2014;many National Guard units in effect federalized&#x2014;made the final, corkscrew landing into Baghdad.<br><br>I was age thirty-one and headed to Iraq, to war, for the first time&#x2014;not as a soldier but on behalf of the State Department. I had left the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in New York after diplomacy there failed, by design. The unnecessary war a commander in chief and the neoconservatives in Washington wanted, Iraqis got . . . and would keep getting for years to come. So did all of us who went over there, year after year after year.<br><br>Hearing that I worked for the State Department, the pilot guiding our flight invited me into the back part of the cockpit to observe our descent into the Middle East. The deserts below were dark, as was the sky. I did not see any stars. It was as if we were flying into a void, somewhere above us was Mars, the Red Planet, named, of course, after the Roman god of war. Compact, calm, and yet talkative, the pilot noted he was nearing retirement, but had volunteered for these special flights because he considered it to be an honor to fly troops to their last point before continuing into Baghdad, into the war. He said he was certain the U.S. needed to invade Iraq. The pilot believed Saddam Hussein was a threat and had hidden weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>Toward the end of our time in the air, with the copilot now flying the plane, the chief pilot gave me one of his business cards, embossed with his special designation as American Airlines&#x2019; &#x201c;senior pilot.&#x201d; I had no idea airlines had Number One pilots, rank ordered in seniority, but what an American notion: Top Dogs, even in commercial fleets.<br><br>With my first of two wars just beginning, it felt like an adventure. I was, oddly enough in retrospect, excited. I was also naive.<br><br>As I left the cockpit, he said he wanted to land in Baghdad one day. At Saddam&#x2019;s old airport before any other commercial U.S. pilot, once civilian flights were cleared to fly beyond Kuwaiti skies.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re American Airlines. We should be the first.&#x201d;<br><br>I kept to myself that I doubted any passengers would be collecting frequent flier miles on their way to and from Iraq anytime soon.<br><br>A few days later I arrived in Baghdad from Kuwait via a sweltering C-130, then by armored convoy into the center of Iraq&#x2019;s now occupied capital city. I suddenly represented the &#x201c;Occupying Power&#x201d; in the middle of Mesopotamia. I did not feel victorious. But I knew I wanted to show a less ugly or arrogant America, the kind that had lectured world leaders in the run-up to the war.<br><br>Few civilians had yet arrived in Iraq to staff the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). Part of the first wave in&#x2014;and probably the most anti&#x2013;Iraq War member of the group&#x2014;I recognized in myself a degree of self-congratulatory pride in that fact: being against the war, but volunteering for it. This stand had cachet tied to it, but also conviction. I was not the kind to complain about Iraq in another &#x201c;March of Folly&#x201d; fashion. That self-righteous phase of mine lasted about a week among friends, over many cups of coffee and a few beers. It got old fast, and they conveyed as much. Better to be in Baghdad, among Iraqis who could tell me what they thought&#x2014;not what I might think they thought from thousands of safe miles away.<br><br>Everything about the place, the Coalition Provisional Authority, indeed felt provisional. Only about fifty State Department personnel had been assigned to help oversee Iraq&#x2019;s occupation and none of us had an at-war roadmap handy. We were hugely outnumbered.<br><br>Based on sheer size, the U.S. military basically ran the country despite Ambassador L. Paul Bremer III&#x2019;s being named by President George W. Bush as top envoy, or Iraq&#x2019;s &#x201c;administrator.&#x201d; With such an anodyne-sounding title, he kept his pinstriped, dark suit attire, often adorned with red ties and white handkerchief. But Bremer also incorporated a different fashion protocol, soon mimicked by his inner circle: instead of State Department wingtips, he wore sand-colored canvas military boots. Granted, in a war zone, this sartorial combination looked odd yet seemed practical. It did not come across that way, however, to Iraqis. To them, boots were only made for stomping, not liberating.<br><br>We all were in way over our heads from the very beginning&#x2014;a gut truth I felt from day one lasting all the way until I departed years later. All of us confronted the same dilemma. No matter what the reasons or the partisan insider connections that had brought us to Iraq as imperialists exported from America, we were linked by ignorance, unrealistic expectations (earnest idealism in some), and growing dangers. A Mission: Impossible.<br><br>I felt stir-crazy after just a week. To escape the palace intrigue and my more Machiavellian-minded colleagues, I ventured out as often and as far as I could, past towering date palm trees (a once famous Iraqi agricultural export) to explore Iraq beyond Saddam&#x2019;s former home&#x2014;its manicured lawns and yellow flowers could be mistaken for a Palm Springs resort, alongside a deep blue Olympic-sized swimming pool with two diving boards, and a barbecue pit. Despite the &#x201c;shock and awe&#x201d; bombing of Baghdad by U.S. warplanes, it somehow retained its dictatorially opulent look and feel.<br><br>When stuck in the palace I would seek out some of the cleaners hired to sweep the ever-present sand from our white marbled floors, who made sure our shoes did not crunch as we navigated the vast floor space. They commuted from Baghdad&#x2019;s poorest Shia neighborhoods into the Green Zone, the ten-square-kilometer, heavily guarded enclave inhabited by coalition officials and military personnel that served as CPA headquarters. I tried to talk with them almost daily, their elementary English far surpassing my virtually nonexistent Arabic. The cleaning crew helped provide me with insights into life beyond the gates. At first, they were wary when I asked them questions, but eventually several opened up. One of the lead custodians, never seen inside without his broom or outside without cigarettes, offered memorable advice.<br><br>&#x201c;Iraqis only respect and fear strength. Democracy won&#x2019;t work in Iraq.&#x201d;<br><br>He probably thought I would whisper his words into Bremer&#x2019;s ear, but I thankfully was not part of the administrator&#x2019;s closed inner circle. But what he said rang true. Iraqis knew all about survival, not voting booths.<br><br>The custodian asked me at one point why we had moved into Saddam&#x2019;s grand palace. I said because it was easiest to secure and convenient. He seemed like he wanted to say something in response, challenge me perhaps, but did not. I guessed what must have been on his mind. Just what kind of message did America intend to send to the Iraqi people as we moved into countless ex-dictator palaces virtually in the first week of our arrival?<br><br>It took between two and three hours each morning for the custodian and other palace cleaning staff to pass through multiple checkpoints, barriers that said everything about our relationship with the Iraqis we professed to know and sought to help. Concrete blast walls. Rings of razor wire. Armed security contractors with black shades and big rifles.<br><br>And badges. Lots of badges, different colors and codes to differentiate us from them. Haves, have-nots&#x2014;those of us inside our climate-controlled bubble versus those who had to sweat out the invasion and growing insurgency.<br><br>Over the next year, dozens of Iraqi day laborers would die from car bombs exploding at the front gates as they waited to enter the Green Zone for another day of work. Theirs was arguably the most deadly, daily commute in Iraq. While at night American expatriates would hold &#x201c;Baghdad Idol&#x201d; contests and &#x201c;Pirate Day&#x201d; poolside parties.<br><br>That same first week, I asked my new boss what part of Iraq&#x2019;s imperial supervision would be mine. I did not want to have anything to do with oil. CPA life morphed into a power trip, temporarily infecting me as well. I confidently believed that I would be given a high-visibility assignment on a pressing political challenge&#x2014;we had so many and all at once&#x2014;given my prior work in New York in the Political Section at the U.S. Mission to the U.N.<br><br>Unexpectedly, however, top CPA management informed me that my new job would be as point man on a very different set of issues and characters: Iraq&#x2019;s truckers. I was not excited. I was not reassured. The only truckers I knew in the U.S. were from movies, and they did not seem to be the most diplomatic of groups. Or friendly.<br><br>This would prove to be the best kind of assignment. I could not have known it then, but Iraq&#x2019;s truckers would quickly become my first true link to the real Iraq. In many ways they comprised the lifeblood of a country in mounting disarray. If any goods needed to be transported from point A to B or all the way to Z, it was the truckers who would get them there. But they were on the verge of a starting a mini-revolt over pay levels and requested an urgent meeting with me.<br><br>The truckers&#x2019; argument lay in a gray area. They claimed Saddam&#x2019;s senior officials had promised them the funds prior to the invasion. As the new de facto government, teamster leaders argued that we were obligated to honor this commitment. So far Ambassador Bremer had vetoed any payout. Before the meeting, I did a bit of homework with our legal team and learned that our authorities under the guiding U.N. Security Council resolution were sweeping, but with limits&#x2014;not all changes had to be made unilaterally by Ambassador Bremer via his signed orders. This gave me some degree of flexibility should I need it.<br><br>I had been warned that the head teamster, Mr. Bassam, was one of the most charismatic and intimidating Iraqis my colleagues had so far engaged in Baghdad. I thought he could not be a harder challenge than the Russian, Chinese, or French diplomats in New York, who sat alongside me on the U.N.&#x2019;s Al Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee. I had negotiated Security Council resolutions with these delegations and sparred over words that were binding upon governments under international law.<br><br>Bassam proved me wrong. Upon finally meeting him, I almost expected to hear a Jersey accent. He was pudgy, bearded, with thick baseball-mitt-sized hands. Tony Soprano would have found a kindred spirit. He smelled of cigarette smoke and liked eating three-foot-long Tigris River carp, the key ingredient in a traditional dish called Masgouf&#x2014;a local bony delicacy also favored by Saddam&#x2014;and, it was rumored, enjoyed by former French president Jacques Chirac, who had the fish flown to Paris and prepared by his personal chefs.<br><br>A trained mechanic, Bassam had risen to be a chief representative of Iraq&#x2019;s hundred-strong teamster high command, a group that controlled massive Volvo truck fleets crucial for stability in the country. He and his men moved food&#x2014;tons of it, daily. Wheat flour, rice, sugar, beans, salt, cooking oil, tea. The staples a majority of Iraqis depended on to feed their families: any breakdown in Iraq&#x2019;s food distribution network could lead to riots and political paralysis. And the teamsters, I realized, had the most leverage. Not us.<br><br>Over that afternoon, with the staid deputy trade minister in suit and tie seated next to me, we listened to the teamsters&#x2019; arguments. It turned out that Saddam functionaries had indeed promised them money. Some truckers were on the verge of revolting as a result of the lack of pay. We simply could not afford any disruption to the supply network, however brief. Finally, Bassam told me that the coalition needed more friends, not enemies, and truckers made good friends.<br><br>Touch�, I thought.<br><br>The balding, elderly minister with his professor-like demeanor looked to me at the end of our session, but said nothing. I sat as an underdressed, decades-younger imperialist. His awkward silence signaled the decision was mine, not his. He handed me two official-looking memos in Arabic, noting one indicated approval, the other rejection. I signed the approval. Bassam reached out and shook my hand, his two-handed grip leaving indentations on my wrist. We both knew who was in charge.<br><br>I began to think how I would explain this unilateral decision of my own, contrary to Bremer&#x2019;s guidance, back at the palace. But in a few days, growing instability across the country became the overriding focus. And Iraqi media reports that the food basket entitlement might be reduced or eliminated by the Americans had led to a growing public outcry&#x2014;&#x201c;introduction of free market forces&#x201d; had been a CPA mantra among some hard-core capitalists while anathema to the more measured British contingent. My instinct had proved right. We needed the truckers on our side. I never heard from Ambassador Bremer on the matter.<br><br>The deputy trade minister estimated my deal with Bassam would cost the Iraqi treasury, which we controlled, several million dollars. Their money spent in our, the Occupying Power&#x2019;s, interest&#x2014;a pattern that would be replicated across other portfolios and amount to many hundreds of millions of dollars in expenditures with little oversight and even less transparency. An Australian colleague described arriving at Baghdad&#x2019;s Central Bank just after the invasion and withdrawing tens of millions of dollars in currency on behalf of Iraqi farmers. He received a handwritten receipt before loading the stacked bills into the back of an SUV.<br><br>This first meeting with Bassam would lead to more before long. I enjoyed the truckers&#x2019; company, and they seemed to enjoy getting to know an American up close. So much so, bonding with Iraq&#x2019;s teamsters soon morphed into the most important, and most rewarding, part of my job during Iraq&#x2019;s official year-long occupation under the Coalition Provisional Authority. They became my rationale for regular trips outside the Green Zone and my link to the more vibrant and gritty Iraq. I visited their mechanic shops, ministry food warehouses, even a Sadr City slum truck lot in order to ensure that food movements proceeded despite mounting insurgent attacks across the country.</p><h2>Out of the Depths: The Story of Ludmila Javorova, Ordained Roman Catholic Priest</h2><p>Miriam Therese Winter traveled to the Czech Republic to interview Ludmila Javorova, a courageous woman ordained in the Roman Catholic underground church in 1970. <i>Out of the Depths</i>&nbsp;is based on exclusive interviews with Javorova and&nbsp;tells her life story.</p><p>Miriam Therese Winter is professor of liturgy, worship, and spirituality and director of the Women&#39;s Leadership Institute at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut."If we wait for a man to approve this, it will never happen, so we must go ahead without it." Felix Davidek spoke these urgent words in 1970 before secretly ordaining Ludmila Javorova, his trusted aide and a woman, as a Roman Catholic priest in Czechoslovakia's underground church. Winter, a Medical Mission Sister in the United States, tells Javorova's full story for the first time in this compelling chronicle of the Koinotes, the fellowship that Davidek, in partnership with Javorova, formed in the 1960s while Czechoslovakia was under harsh Communist rule. Winter's account of Koinotes is disjointed and clumsy in places, but its essential facts are so intriguing as to cover even a multitude of literary sins. Though told in Javorova's voice, the story reaches beyond her extraordinary ordination to embrace the man who made it possible: Davidek, the passion-filled priest who was consecrated a bishop in the underground church in 1967. Davidek died in 1988, before the fall of Communism in 1989 and before his protge's clandestine ordination became widely known. Although she is barred by the Vatican from functioning as a priest, Javorova has emerged as a heroine of the women's ordination movement, particularly in the American Catholic Church. Proponents of the cause will applaud her courage, and even opponents will find it difficult to not be impressed with her spirituality and humility. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Soup on Ice</h2><p>Soup and Rob convince a reluctant Santa that Soup&#39;s wind-powered sleigh will be the hit of the tree-lighting ceremonies, but they never imagine the consequences of their suggestion</p><p></p><h2>Two Cheers for Capitalism</h2><p>Points to the current ideological assault on American enterprise by a new class of professionals, intellectuals, and government officials and urges capitalists to recognize that they are maintaining basic values as well as producing profits</p><p></p><h2>The Betel Chewing Traditions in South-East Asia (Images of Asia)</h2><p>Betel chewing is one of the most ancient and widespread traditions of the peoples of South-East Asia, and encompasses an estimated one-tenth of the world&#39;s population.

Driven by visions of the dead, Parker tracks a serial killer from New York City to the Deep South and finds his buried instincts -- for love, survival, and, ultimately, for killing -- awakening as he confronts a monster beyond imagining....</p><p>It's a good idea to avoid reading John Connolly's debut novel on a full stomach. His descriptions of mutilated murder victims give him honorary membership in the gore wars club. <i>Every Dead Thing</i> is a fast-paced piece of fiction from an author whose regular stomping ground is as a journalist for the <i>Irish Times</i>. <p> NYPD detective Charlie "Bird" Parker was busy boozing at Tom's Oak Tavern when his wife Susan, and young daughter Jennifer were mutilated by a killer called the Traveling Man. Consumed by guilt and alcoholism, Charlie soon lost his job, and almost his sanity. Several months on he is sober and ready to get his life back in order. Charlie takes up private investigating. One of his first cases involves the disappearance of a woman called Catherine Demeter. At first this puzzle seems unrelated to the Traveling Man--but Charlie has a gut feeling that the slayer is pulling the strings. "I dreamed of Catherine Demeter surrounded by darkness and flames and the bones of dead children. And I knew then that some terrible blackness had descended upon her."</p><p> The search for Catherine takes Charlie on a whirlwind tour of the South. First to the small Virginian town of Haven, where, some 30 years before, Catherine's sister Amy was murdered, along with other local children. But the trail turns cold--until a tip from a psychic leads Charlie to the swamplands of Louisiana. The subplots of Catherine's disappearance, age-old child murders, and the slaying of the Parker family finally unite in the hot, humid terrain. A showdown with the Traveling Man is inevitable.</p><p> <i>Every Dead Thing</i> is classic American crime fiction, and it's hard to believe that John Connolly was born and raised on the Emerald Isle. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>John Connolly is the author of the Charlie Parker series of mystery novels, the supernatural collection <i>Nocturnes,</i> the Samuel Johnson Trilogy for younger readers, and (with Jennifer Ridyard) the Chronicles of the Invaders series.

She is best known for Little Women (1868), a semiautobiographical account of her childhood years with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts. Alcott, unlike Jo, never married: &#34;&#34;...because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man.&#34;&#34; She was an advocate of women&#39;s suffrage and was the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts.Grade 5 Up Louisa May Alcott's charming, although now somewhat dated, companion piece to the perennially popular <i>Little Women</i> highlights the life of the wildest of the March sisters, Jo, now married to her professor, and presiding as the harried but happy mistress over the Plumfield Estate School home to a small group of needy boys, relatives, and sons whose mischievous antics and emotional upheavals provide ample opportunities for Alcott to share her personal philosophy about learning and life.

She asked them to tell her about the intimate details of their lives, which they did with remarkable candor. Having earned their trust, Wallerstein was rewarded with a deeply moving portrait of each of their lives as she followed them from childhood, through their adolescent struggles, and into adulthood. With <em>The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce</em>, Wallerstein offers us the only close-up study of divorce ever conducted -- a unique report that will change our fundamental beliefs about divorce and offer new hope for the future. <p>Wallerstein chooses seven children who most embody the common life experiences of the larger group and follows their lives in vivid detail through adolescence and into their love affairs, their marriage successes and failures, and parenting their own children. In Wallerstein's hands, the experiences and anxieties of this generation of children, now in their late twenties to early forties, come to life. We watch as they struggle with the fear that their relationships will fail like those of their parents. Lacking an internal template of what a successful relationship looks like, they must invent their own codes of behavior in a culture that offers many models and few guidelines. Wallerstein shows how many over-came their dread of betrayal to find loving partners and to become successful, protective parents -- and how others are still struggling to find their heart's desire without knowing why they feel so frightened. She also demonstrates their great strengths and accomplishments, as a generation of survivors who often had to raise themselves and help their parents through difficult times. </p><p>For the first time, using a comparison group of adults who grew up in the same communities, Wallerstein shows how adult children of divorce essentially view life differently from their peers raised in intact homes where parents also confronted marital difficulties but decided on balance to stay together. In this way she sheds light on the question so many parents confront -- whether to stay unhappily married or to divorce. </p><p><em>The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce</em> should be essential reading for all adult children of divorce, their lovers, their partners, divorced parents or those considering divorce, judges, attorneys, and mental health professionals. Challenging some of our most cherished beliefs, this is a book that will forever alter how we think about divorce and its long-term impact on American society.</p></p><p>During the last 40 years, our society's views on how families are created and how they operate has undergone a tremendous shift. In <i>The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce</i>, authors Judith Wallerstein, Julia Lewis, and Sandra Blakeslee have assembled a variety of stories from people of different ages and life stages. Some are children of divorce, some are from families that stayed unhappily intact, but all of them offer valuable information important to all of us as parents, children, and members of society at large. Separate chapters focus on the different roles children take on in the event of a divorce or unhappy marriage, ranging from positive role model to deeply troubled adolescent. In many cases, the people interviewed continue to define themselves as children of divorce up to 30 years after the occurrence; this is described by one subject as "sort of a permanent identity, like being adopted or something."<p> Both encouraging and thought-provoking, the final chapter questions how we maintain the freedom made possible by divorce while, at the same time, minimizing the damage. The authors' response to this question begins with pragmatic suggestions about strengthening marriage--not bland "family values" rhetoric but practical how-to ideas combined with national policy initiatives that have been making the rounds for years. With fascinating stories and statistics, Wasserstein, Lewis, and Blakeslee have illuminated the improvements within reach while our society experiences these massive changes in it's most fundamental relationships. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><b>JUDITH S.

In <i>The Big Chair</i>, he lets readers in on the real GM experience from his unique vantage point&#x2014;sharing the inner workings of three of the top franchises in the sport, revealing the out-of-the-headlines machinations behind the trades, the hires and the deals; how the money really works; how the decision-making really works; how much power the players really have and why&#x2014;the real brass tacks of some of the most pivotal decisions made in baseball history that led to great success along with heartbreak and failure on the field. Baseball fans will come for the grit and insight, stay for the heart, and pass it on for the wisdom. <br><br>Ned Colletti began his MLB career with his beloved hometown team, the Chicago Cubs, more than 35 years ago. He worked in Chicago for a dozen years and was in the front office when the Cubs won the National League East in 1984 and 1989, after which he moved on as director of baseball operations for the SF Giants. By 1996, he became the Assistant GM for the Giants, before being hired as the GM in Los Angeles in 2006. There he oversaw the Dodgers through the highly publicized and acrimonious divorce battle between Frank and Jamie McCourt that culminated in the equally highly publicized sale of the team. He was present at the press conference where Don Mattingly, having just watched his team eliminated from the playoffs, used the post-season conference to vehemently discuss his lack of a contract extension. He brought marquee names like Greg Maddux and Clayton Kershaw to LA, as well as marquee drama with the likes of Manny Ramirez and Yasiel Puig; hired future Hall of Famer Joe Torre as manager; and oversaw fourteen Dodgers playoff wins. And these are just a few of the highlights.&nbsp; <br><br>Colletti serves up a huge dish of first-hand experiences with some of the biggest names in baseball history (Barry Bonds, Greg Maddux, Don Mattingly, Don Zimmer, Tommy Lasorda, Scott Boras, Vin Scully, and more).

The publication of Wild Swans in 1991 was a worldwide phenomenon. Not only did it become the best-selling non-fiction book in British publishing history, with sales of well over two million, it was received with unanimous critical acclaim, and was named the winner of the 1992 NCR Book Award and the 1993 British Book of the Year Award. Few books have ever had such an impact on their readers. Through the story of three generations of women - grandmother, mother and daughter - Wild Swans tells nothing less than the whole tumultuous history of China&#39;s tragic twentieth century, from sword-bearing warlords to Chairman Mao, from the Manchu Empire to the Cultural Revolution. At times terrifying, at times astonishing, always deeply moving, Wild Swans is a book in a million, a true story with all the passion and grandeur of a great novel.</p><p>In <i>Wild Swans</i> Jung Chang recounts the evocative, unsettling, and insistently gripping story of how three generations of women in her family fared in the political maelstrom of China during the 20th century. Chang's grandmother was a warlord's concubine. Her gently raised mother struggled with hardships in the early days of Mao's revolution and rose, like her husband, to a prominent position in the Communist Party before being denounced during the Cultural Revolution. Chang herself marched, worked, and breathed for Mao until doubt crept in over the excesses of his policies and purges. Born just a few decades apart, their lives overlap with the end of the warlords' regime and overthrow of the Japanese occupation, violent struggles between the Kuomintang and the Communists to carve up China, and, most poignant for the author, the vicious cycle of purges orchestrated by Chairman Mao that discredited and crushed millions of people, including her parents."This is a powerful, moving, at times shocking account of three generations of Chinese women, as compelling as Amy Tan." --Mary Morris.<p> "An evocative, often astonishing view of life in a changing China." -- <i>The New York Times</i></p></p><h2>Pagans &amp; Christians: The Personal Spiritual Experience</h2><p>Although Christianity is still a major religious force, there are growing numbers of people in other faiths, including the various Pagan traditions. Some Christians have responded to this trend with fear and derision, while some Pagans have reacted to that fear with anger and mistrust. <br> <br>Much of the problem is due to misunderstandings and lack of communication. This can change with Gus diZerega's <i>Pagans &amp; Christians</i>. Here you will find a penetrating and illuminating comparison, showing that neither path has the single correct approach to the Divine. Rather, either or both can be authentic and legitimate expressions of the appreciation of the Ultimate Source of All. <br> <br><i>Pagans &amp; Christians</i> is an ideal way to help bridge what at time seems a wide chasm between Christian and Pagan beliefs. By sharing core ideas of both paths, this book provides a way to give deeper mutual understanding and unity among the religions of the world. <br> <br>Although <i>Pagans &amp; Christians</i> accepts both paths as valid, the book provides a more in-depth explanation of Paganism � &nbsp;the minority religion because in some ways, Paganism demands a greater defense and explanation of its beliefs and ideas to dispel misunderstandings. The author is a Third Degree Gardenerian Elder and in <i>Pagans &amp; Christians</i> has presented nothing less than a brilliant defense of Paganism, clearly showing how it should stand beside all of the major religions of the world as an equal. As part of this defense, diZerega gives a listing of biblical contradictions and Christian philosophical difficulties which can help any Pagan responding to a negative attack, and will help any Christian to view his or her religion as a way, not the way. <br> <br>Winner of the 2001 Coalition of Visionary Resources (COVR) Award for Best Non-fiction Book <br> <br></p><p>In modern society there is plenty which seems to take us away from our spiritual paths. Perhaps the last thing we need is to disagree with another simply because his or her chosen path is not ours. That is why I feel <i>Pagans &amp; Christians</i> by Gus diZerega is such an important book. <br> <br>In <i>Pagans &amp; Christians</i> you will find a remarkable feat: a book that is both lively and entertaining as well as scholarly and eloquent. The author's analysis of Christianity and Paganism offers, for the first time, a true basis for interreligious discussion. The more we talk and share, the more we will understand each other and be able to live in peace. <br> <br>Within these pages you will find a clear picture of what Paganism really is; what its real roots are. The practices and beliefs of the modern Pagan are presented as they contrast and harmonize with those of their Christian counterparts. You will discover how Pagans relate to the Divine, and why Nature plays such a central role in their faith. The book explains what Pagans believe about evil, suffering, and the devil. <br> <br>You may be Christian, Pagan, or of any other spiritual path. Whatever you choose to believe, if you take to heart the commandment "Love one another," <i>Pagans &amp; Christians</i> will help you clear away the roadblocks of fear and misunderstanding. <br> <br><p>Gus Dizerega (Washington) is a Third-Degree Gardnerian Elder.

Its wording is direct: The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&#x201d; However, there is not a single Supreme Court decision based on it. Even the famously ambitious Warren Court preferred to rely on the weaker support of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause for many of its decisions on individual rights. Since that era, mainstream conservatives have grown actively hostile to the very mention of the Ninth Amendment. Daniel Farber, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, makes an informed and lucid argument for employing the Ninth Amendment in support of a large variety of rights whose constitutional basis is now shaky. The case he makes for the application of this unused amendment has profound implications in almost every aspect of our daily lives.</p><p><b>Daniel Farber</b> earned his J.D. from the University of Illinois. He clerked for Judge Philip W. Tone of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and for Justice John Paul Stevens of the United States Supreme Court. He is one of the ten most frequently cited American legal scholars. Currently teaching at theUC-Berkeley Law School, he lives in Oakland, California.Farber, a constitutional law professor at the UC-Berkeley law school (<i>Desperately Seeking Certainty</i>), challenges the Supreme Court's current jurisprudence regarding "fundamental rights," arguing that rather than relying on the Constitution's due process clause, these rights&#x2014;which touch on many controversial issues like abortion, consensual sex, gay marriage and the right to die&#x2014;would better be supported by the Ninth Amendment. That amendment says that the enumeration of certain rights in the Constitution "shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." Farber deals with the tricky question of what rights are fundamental (he concludes there is a right to terminate unwanted medical intervention but not a right to assisted suicide) and the legal basis for such rights. He also makes lucid and convincing criticisms of particular Supreme Court approaches in abortion rights, for instance. This is potentially an important book that offers a new approach to how courts should interpret the Constitution when balancing fundamental individual rights against government incursions, an approach Farber believes will hold up better to challenges than a due-process approach. Farber writes well for the general public and succeeds in building a case that will resonate with both liberals and populist-conservatives. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Richard Matheson's premise is captivating: What if you were a dying young man, visiting a turn-of-the-century resort hotel? And what if you fell in love with a painting of a beautiful stage actress--but she had lived and died a century before? But--what if your love was so strong that you could literally will yourself back in time to become part of her world? In the tradition of the classic romantic ghost story "Portrait of Jennie," Matheson makes his two lovers totally believable, and so the undeniably fantastic premise soon becomes completely acceptable. The author would later write another unique love story--of love after death--called <i>What Dreams May Come</i>, that is somewhat less bittersweet. (<i>Bid Time Return</i> was later filmed as <i>Somewhere in Time</i>, and some editions are issued under that title.) <i>--Stanley Wiater</i></p><h2>A Tale of Two Cities (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>During the French Revolution, a young Englishman gives up his life in order to save the husband of the woman he loves</p><p>The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen.

For the first time, this vast heritage is revealed in all its unparalleled glory ill hundreds of magnificent full-color photographs -- including many breathtaking close-ups and details -- and texts by some of the world&#39;s leading Egyptologists. Alongside the legendary treasures of Tutankhamun are some of the most impressive examples of Egyptian sculpture, wall paintings, and decorative art from the pyramid complexes of Giza, Saqqara, and Dahshur, the royal necropolis of Thebes, and the Temple of Karnak, among other fascinating sites. From the finest jewelry to the most imposing statues, every artifact is captured in startling clarity -- with special lighting techniques that evoke, as never before, the awe and wonder inspired by these fabulous ancient treasures.</p><p>Written by British curator Malek (In the Shadow of the Pyramids: Egypt During the Old Kingdom), Egyptian Art is another in Phaidon's solid "Art &amp; Ideas" series. It follows the tradition of other titles in The other three titles were published to coincide with the international traveling exhibition "Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramid," seen recently at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art (MOMA). When the Pyramids Were Built is a streamlined version of the official catalog. With no index, it will not be a first choice for reference, but Arnold (the curator of the Egyptian department at MOMA) provides a well-written and very accessible text. Its readability, combined with the quality of the photographs and the modest price, makes this an excellent purchase for most public libraries. The 25 internationally respected Egyptologists who contributed to Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids provide a valuable look at recent developments in the field. In particular, the redating of many artifacts results in a very different view of the artistic trends of the period. The profuse illustrations vary in quality, but their sheer number, added to the high-level scholarship of the text and the three detailed indexes (general, sites, and owners of the artifacts), makes this an important book for all academic and most medium and large public libraries. Egyptian Treasures from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo covers a much greater time span than the other three titles. The text, written by a virtual who's who in Egyptology, is a bit uneven--as is usually the case with so many authors. However, all of the text is comprehensible, and some of it (such as the argument that Tutankhamun was not murdered) is fascinating. Unfortunately, there is no index, but the layout is chronological, giving some hope of finding specific artifacts. The real treasure of the book lies in Araldo De Luca's stunning photographs. Often, De Luca sees with his camera's eye things that few visitors would notice. The book's large trim allows for many life-size illustrations, and at all times the illustrations do justice to a phenomenal collection. Highly recommended for all academic and most public libraries.<br><i>-Mary Morgan Smith, Northland P.L., Pittsburgh </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc....appealing, with artfully arranged photographs and illustrations, and an entertaining introduction by Tiradritti on how the museum came to exist. -- <i><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>, Suzanne MacNeille</i></p><h2>Califia&#39;s Daughters: A Novel</h2><p><b>Set in the near future and inspired by the captivating myth of the warrior queen Califia, this brilliantly inventive novel tells the story of a small, peaceful community of women tucked away in a world gone mad.</b><br><br>Only the elders of the Valley remember life the way it used to be...when people traveled in automobiles and bought food others had grown.

From a distance, no unaided human eye could have picked out the dun and dusty figures from the grass around them; nonetheless, they were there, one long, slim human and two massive dogs. They had been on the hillside since morning, and they moved little.<br><br>Their presence had not gone completely undetected. An hour earlier a small herd of white-tailed deer quartering the hillside had abruptly cut short its graze to veer nervously away. Twice, sentinel quail settling into the arms of the twisted stump had alerted their flock to direct their attentions elsewhere. And now a turkey vulture appeared above the far side of the valley, gliding in languid circles on the updraft that rose off twenty acres of crumbling asphalt and debris, the remains of an office complex from Before. The bird spotted the three prone figures and sifted the wind through the distinctive fingers of her pinions, sidling across the currents to take a position a hundred feet above the invisible figures. Hopeful thoughts flickered through her tiny brain and she dropped lower, then lower still, until one of the bodies jerked about to gnaw its flank, and another, the long one, turned its face to the sky and waved an arm. Faint avian disappointment came and went at these unmistakable signs of life, and the bird slid sideways toward the next valley. The three figures resumed their motionless watch.<br><br>Now, however, their stillness was one of alertness, even tension, rather than mere waiting. The human, no longer completely covered by the diminishing shadow of the grease bush, stared intently through a pair of large and ancient Artifact binoculars at the hillside ten miles away, where a faint haze of dust teased up from the ridge. In a few minutes the haze solidified into a cloud, its source coming clear: travelers. Eyes--blue human, yellow canine--focused on the spot, watching the drift of dust move down the face of the hill, saw the half-obscured wagons pause to weigh the temptation of the direct route through the Remnant against the unknown threats it could hide, saw the travelers turn to circle well clear of the tumbled remains. When the wagons had safely negotiated the dry streambed and regained the road, when it became clear that the travelers were firmly committed to the left-hand fork, the binoculars went into their case, the weapons were gathered up, and woman and dogs slithered over the top of the hill and disappeared.<br>judith<br><br>Two hours later, near the place where the road's left fork dwindled to its end, another woman watched for another small cloud of dust to rise against a backdrop of trees, chewing her lip with impatience. Her name was Judith, and she sat perched on the top step of a sprawling old farmhouse that had once been painted white, shelling dried beans. Her bare toes were drawn back from the hot edge of the sun on the next step down; the worn boards and pathway below were thick with beans that had missed the bowl under the sharp, irritable jerks of her work-hardened fingers. <br><br>Judith didn't even see the waste she was making. Her eyes were on the Valley entrance, her inner gaze fixed on that vision of the morning's frantic activity--no, call it what it was: panic, mindless and dangerous, that had gone on far, far too long. Bringing the Valley into line had been like pushing a laden cart uphill, and Judith ached with the strain. But at last the long-unused emergency drills were recalled, and order jerkily took hold, and finally the gears meshed and things ran smoothly: guards out, weapons ready, all metaphorical hatches securely battened.<br><br>Now there was nothing left to do but wait. Forty minutes earlier she had found herself standing alone on the veranda, wishing she had gone with Dian, wondering if she shouldn't take a position at the Gates with a rifle, half-yearning for a return of the morning's upheaval just so she'd have something to keep her occupied--until she heard what she was thinking and berated herself: For God's sake, you're a lousy shot, Dian's better off without you, and you should be grateful things finally calmed down. Go find something to do!<br><br>So she'd found a mindless task and settled to it--badly, with shameful waste--and waited for Dian.<br><br>The worst part was the silence. She felt smothered under it, this strange, thick stillness where there was usually the workaday noise of an active community--children shouting and adult voices raised in work and song, the rumble and thump of the mill machinery, the echo of hammer and the rasp of saw and the jingle of harnessed horses pulling plow or cart. The myriad sounds that made up the daily voice of the Valley were gone, the core of its life locked up and guarded in the hillside caves high above the farmhouse. The oddly muted sounds of cow and goat drifted down from the upper pastures; the cock crowed in protest from the enclosed run behind the barn. Even the imperturbable blue jay that haunted the walnut tree seemed flustered at the impact his raucous voice made on the still air and flew off into the redwoods. Judith listened to the few voices of low speech, the crackle and patter of the beans dropping into the basket, the breath soughing in and out through her nose: no competition for the pervasive quiet. The hot air shivered with silence, and Judith watched the Gates.<br><br>Not actual gates, of course, not like Meijing had--there was no way to wall the area against determined invaders, although God knew they'd talked about it, especially, Judith gathered, during the early years. But the Valley was peculiarly well suited for defense, the hills at its back steep and heavily wooded, the low ground in front marshy where the creek spread out between a pair of rocky prongs. And then, when the worst of the riots had been raging Outside, the community had responded to an unspoken urge to strengthen those prongs and built them higher and thicker until the Gates came into being. Nothing high explosives or a concerted effort wouldn't push aside, but a few armed women atop the structure would slow an enemy down.<br><br>As now it seemed to be slowing Dian, damn it. The minutes crawled, beans continued to fall into the bowl and across the steps, and then finally, a faint suggestion of dust rising into the air down toward the Valley entrance. A minute later, sounds reached through the utter silence: a woman's faraway voice--Dian's, she was sure, calling a salute to her unseen sentries. In a minute Judith could hear the clear thud of cantering hooves on the planks of the lower bridge; her eyes shifted to the dam, the pond behind it as unnaturally motionless as the air without its usual midday complement of splashing bodies, the mill frozen against the weight of the collected waters. After four long minutes Dian appeared around the side of the mill, her horse at a trot. The smaller dog, a two-year-old brindle that stood thirty-four inches at the shoulder, shot away from her side to galumph like a mad ox through the shallow edges of the mill pond, heaving up great sheets of water at each stride until it stopped, belly-deep, to lap furiously. The other dog, fawn-colored and bigger by three inches and forty pounds, remained at Dian's left stirrup until she turned her horse's head to the water. Then he, too, waded forward to drink. Judith watched him closely for an indication of Dian's feelings, and was relieved when he appeared relaxed enough to snap playfully at the water.<br><br>Dian only allowed her animals a small refreshment before pulling the horse back onto the road and whistling the dogs to her side. Judith heard hoofbeats again as Dian crossed the mill bridge; as if the sound had been a signal, the rider shifted in the saddle to peer up at the house, then threw up an arm in greeting.<br><br>Judith started to rise, only to exclaim in exasperation both at the basket, which nearly upended down the steps, and at the awkwardness caused by her expanding belly. She thrust the beans to one side and stepped into the full sun to respond with a wide wave. In another moment Dian disappeared behind the apple orchard. Judith continued down the steps, pausing to bend laboriously and gather a few stray beans, then abandoned the project to set off across the stunted lawn to the entrance of the farmyard proper.<br><br>Dian would reach her in two minutes, and Judith compromised with her impatience by standing at the gatepost in the shade of the old walnut, the farmyard's guardian since the first rough shack had been raised there by her great-great-grandparents. The five-bar gate itself was so choked with weeds and walnut sprouts that it would have taken a crew to force it shut, but as other gates now kept livestock from the crops, there was no need. She leaned her arms on the top of the fence, which like everything in the Valley needed paint, and breathed in the acrid odor of the thick, oily leaves. Over and around her hung thousands of smooth green nuts the size of a baby's fist, still tightly wrapped in their husks, a good month yet from harvest. Her own time would follow theirs, by two or three weeks. She smoothed her belly and pictured the soft, pale infant walnuts straining against their spongy husks, then her mouth twisted in irritation and she moved out into the hot road. Think about something else. Think about the travelers.<br><br>It was Dian, inevitably, who had seen the approaching wagons, at dawn. She had been out on one of her increasingly frequent and far-ranging overnight forays and had spotted them many miles away, and waited only long enough to be reasonably sure of their destination before riding hard for home. At nine o'clock that morning Judith had been down at the mill contemplating an obstinate piece of machinery when there was a stir of alarmed voices along the road. She stepped out of the mill house to see Dian clattering up the road on a horse white with lather and shockingly near foundering, Culum gamely at her heels and no sign of the two other dogs she'd set out with. The sweaty rider reined in the instant she saw Judith.<br><br>"What happened?" Judith was demanding before Dian's boots hit the ground.<br><br>Dian glanced at the curious faces turned their way, and called to one of the youngsters.<br><br>"Patty, would you do me a big favor, and take Simon here up to the barn? You know what to do with a hot horse?"<br><br>"Of course," the child said, with the perfect disdain of a ten-year-old, and took the reins. She had to pull with all her weight to get the exhausted animal moving again.<br><br>"Thank you, Pats. Okay, Culum, you can go home now." The huge dog seemed to nod his shaggy head at her as he passed, ambling off at a bone-weary plod. Dian turned to the other adults.<br><br>"I need to talk to Judith for a minute," she said apologetically, and they faded away with curious glances and concerned remarks. Dian waited until they were out of earshot, then turned urgently to Judith.<br><br>"Jude, there are people on the road. Two wagons and a bunch of riders, at least ten or twelve."<br><br>"Coming here?"<br><br>"Where else is there?"<br><br>"Couldn't they just be tinkers or traders or something?"<br><br>"Didn't look right, and tinkers would know not to ride through the hill road. Besides, they looked, I don't know, purposeful. Tightly bunched, but moving as fast as they could manage."<br><br>"Two wagons, though--what's the worry? We stop them outside the Gates and see what they want."<br><br>"Last year it only took one wagon, with some kind of gun inside, to wipe out the Smithy village," she reminded Judith grimly. Judith winced at the memory of dry blood and buzzing flies, and studied her sister's face.<br><br>"You're nervous about this. In fact, I could swear you look frightened. You're having one of your Feelings about those wagons, aren't you?" Judith's emphasis put a capital letter on the word, recognition that, every so often, Dian seemed to know things she couldn't.<br><br>"Yes, and no. They seem wrong, somehow. Not necessarily dangerous, just very wrong. I don't like the idea of them coming here with us all open like this." Her hand gesture took in the scene: the nearby field with its paused workers, the cluster of gaping children, the slim young man walking down the road.<br><br>Judith's eyes thoughtfully followed this last figure, her cousin Philip, before returning to Dian.<br><br>"You want me to call an alert," she said flatly.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"When we're all working from dawn to dark to get the crops in, you want me to declare a day off, so everyone can go play in the caves."<br><br>Dian heard the thread of capitulation hidden beneath the protest, and looked sideways at Judith, summoning a faint air of mischief.<br><br>"We'll have some nice babies in May," she suggested.<br><br>"It's no joking matter, damn it!" Judith exploded. "I can't go around calling alerts because someone feels nervous, even if it is you. This is serious."<br><br>Dian's attempt at humor faded.<br><br>"You can't honestly think I don't realize that?" she asked quietly.<br><br>"Oh, no, Di, I know you do. Sorry to be so touchy. The heat." Dian nodded. "It's a strong feeling, then?"<br><br>"It is."<br><br>"Strong enough to nearly kill a horse and abandon two dogs," Judith noted.<br><br>"They'll find their way home--Maggie bruised her foot--but, yes, that strong."<br><br>"There's going to be screaming about this."<br><br>"But you'll do it."<br><br>"Yes, damn it, I'll do it. We need a break anyway, and I suppose it'll do us good. When do you think they'll be here?"<br><br>"The road's bad and they've got two creeks to ford--if the wagons and riders stay together, they won't arrive until dark. If they abandon the wagons and ride hard, they could be here in four, five hours. I'll talk to Laine and Jeri, and if Carmen will trust me with another horse I'll go back and watch the road. I don't think we should wait too long to clear the place. At least get the menfolk out of the way."<br><br>Judith glanced nervously down toward the entrance to the Valley.<br><br>"You're sure about this?"<br><br>"No," Dian answered unhelpfully.<br><br>"Your hunches are usually right."<br><br>"Maybe this time I'll be wrong," she said, but her voice said she did not think it likely.<br><br>"All right, then, we'd better get on with it. What do you want me to do?"</p><h2>Lucy in the Afternoon: An Intimate Memoir of Lucille Ball</h2><p>A close friend of the late Queen of Comedy presents an account of her life and thoughts, from New York to Hollywood and through the show that remains an American institution</p><p>Diehard Lucille Ball nuts are the likely readers of this corny star biography. Brochu, an admitted I Love Lucy freak, was 14 when he saw his heroine in a Broadway play and apparently never got over it. Years later, near the end of her life, he became a daily afternoon fixture for backgammon and conversation. Readers who can stomach Brochu's constant self-aggrandizement--the book actually opens and closes with his dreams about Lucy--will come away with some interesting stories about her phenomenal rise on TV, marriage to and breakup from Desi Arnaz, and relationships with co-stars ranging from Bob Hope to Richard Burton. There's no denying that Ball was a pioneering force in TV comedy; it's too bad that this "special friend's loving tribute" is so fawning.<br><i>- Kevin Sweeney, Chicago</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.In the late 1980s, screenwriter and admitted Lucille Ball "freak" Brochu wrote a play he had envisioned as a vehicle for his idol. Though she turned down the part, he found himself drawn into the commedienne's inner circle. Ball's last months serve as a backdrop for this abbreviated, unrevealing biography, which retraces familiar ground with an emphasis on the star's wisecracks. Brochu chronicles his infatuation with Ball; after meeting her, he virtually rearranged his life to accommodate a daily rendezvous. Brochu succeeds in capturing the star's high spirits, yet, disappointingly, the book is little more than a collection of remembrances of days passed pleasantly, with backgammon and easy banter, in each other's company.

Taken from his mother as an infant, he was raised in Cuba by paternal relatives. At six he went to Spain with his father to become a page in the service of the Spanish prince. In his twenties, Martin fought as a soldier of Spain in Germany, France, and Algeria. Later, Martin was ultimately fated to resist the Spanish Crown and to die far from anywhere he might call home. Today, he is remembered by Mexicans as the first mestizo, emblematic of Mexico's dual heritage.Like Lanyon's earlier book, <i>Malinche's Conquest</i> , this one is an engrossing and evocative story, bringing to life those extraordinary times in the sixteenth century. It is a tale of intrigue and identity, exploring Martin Cortes's relations with his famous father, his half-brother, his mother's people, and his Spanish and New World loyalties. It is a stimulating reflection on the processes of history and legend and on the nature of the human spirit caught between conflicting worlds.</p><p><b>Anna Lanyon</b> teaches and translates Spanish. She is the author of <i>Malinche's Conquest</i> , which won the New South Wales Premiere History Prize for historical writing. She lives in Australia.In this well-researched and attractive exploration of the life of the "first mestizo," or "the first 'Mexican,' " Australian writer Lanyon (<i>Malinche's Conquest</i>) tells the dramatic tale of Mart�n Cort�s, the son of Hern�n Cort�s and the Amerindian woman Malinche, from his birth in 1522 in Tenochtitl�n&#x2013;Mexico City to his death less than five decades later near Granada. The story traces his passage to Spain as a six-year-old, long years of royal service under Charles V and the disastrous return to Mexico, where&#x2014;accused of conspiracy against the Crown&#x2014;Mart�n confronts imprisonment and brutal torture. Lanyon effectively interweaves historical reconstruction with personal narrative, crossing the divide between traveler and scholar in order to evoke the human immediacy of history. Lanyon is always receptive to the unsolicited clue and the unexpected sight connecting her, and us, to Martin's multiple new worlds. Waiting for a train in Madrid, Lan yon observes the immigrant faces: the "people of empire" who have crossed the Atlantic to stake their own modest claims on Spain. Lanyon avoids romanticizing the victims of conquest, but is acutely aware of the suffering of the indigenous peoples, and her fleeting analogies with the trauma of the Australian aborigines are illuminating. There are a few mistakes in her references to Spain before Empire, yet this remains a deeply likable book with significance beyond its immediate subject.

He follows the changing trends in the making and significance of art in different cultures, and explains why the art of the day looked and functioned as it did. Key images and objects-some of them familiar works of art; others, less known but equally crucial to the story-act as landmarks on the journey, focal points around which the discussion always centers. Along the way, Bell answers fundamental questions such as "What is art and where does it start?" and "Why do humans make it and how does it serve them?"</p><p>Previous histories tended to focus only on the masterpieces of Western art, in the process excluding the work of women or non-Western artists, or else considering developments around the world as separate, unrelated phenomena. Bell's achievement is to take a global perspective, bringing the distinct stories together in one convincing narrative. He draws insightful and inspired connections between different continents and cultures and across the millennia, which results in a rich and seamless introduction to the world of visual creativity.</p><p>Hundreds of carefully selected illustrations show how artists from different ages and societies often shared the same formal, technical, and aesthetic concerns, while others took divergent paths when their vision dictated it.</p><p>Julian Bell, himself a well-known painter, is the grandson of Vanessa and Clive Bell, key members of the celebrated Bloomsbury group of writers and artists. His books include <em>What is Painting?</em>.</p></p><p>Julian Bell is a well-known artist, writer, and critic. His work has been widely exhibited in New York and London.Starred Review. Bell's guidelines in writing this exuberant, astute and splendidly illustrated history of world art-spanning from the cave paintings of Lascaux through contemporary artists such as Julie Mehretu-are threefold: every work is complemented by a reproduction, the narrative is chronological, and art is viewed as "a frame within which world history, in all its breadth, is continually reflected back at us." Bell (500 Self-Portraits; What is Painting?: Representation and Modern Art) is a renowned critic, artist and professor of art history, and son of artist and critic Quentin Bell; he writes of his personal "pleasure" in creating and studying art. Bell draws fascinating parallels between artistic developments in Western and non-Western art: a discussion of Brancusi highlights the influence of West African carving on his work; one of Borromini's domes is juxtaposed with its near contemporary in the Masjid-e-Shah mosque in Isfahan. The survey is selective, presenting some typically overlooked works, but Bell trains his probing perspective to each. His conclusion is unpretentious: he advises readers to supplement his study with "finer-grained art histories" and to "get close to the work itself." Best, he says, is to make things oneself: "What happens in art is up to you." The unique study will appeal to anyone-from the generalist to the scholar-interested in a discriminating and perceptive history of world art.

During this period, African Americans gained their freedom and the right to vote, but essentially lost them again to such forces as the Ku Klux Klan, Black Codes and Jim Crow laws, and the "separate but equal" concept passed down in the Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson. These and the other obstacles that pervaded almost every aspect of African-American life are discussed. Some strides are examined in reference to the "Great Migration," Brown v. Board of Education, and the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Major civil rights leaders are profiled, including Booker T. Washington, Ida B. Wells, W. E. B. Du Bois, Thurgood Marshall, and Rosa Parks. Quotes and excerpts from primary sources are introduced through sidebars. Occasional black-and-white photographs illustrate the volume.

The moderate cost houses described in this book and profusely illustrated with 116 photographs, plans and drawings, are houses - of infinite variety for people of limited means - in which living has become for their owners a purposeful new adventure in freedom and dignity. Mr. Wright tells the story of the world famous &#34;Usonian&#34; houses, so that we now see, in text and illustrations, how they have evolved from original conception to final execution. He has also written a step-by-step description of the &#34;Usonion Automatic,&#34; explaining just how that remarkable house is built - a simplified method of construction so devised that the owners themselves can build it with great economy and beauty. For this purpose, there are, in addition to Mr. Wright&#39;s text, special photographs and drawings of the method and materials, showing clearly how the Usonion Automatic is built.</p><p></p><h2>Journey to a Woman</h2><p>Designated the "Queen of Lesbian Pulp" for her series of landmark novels beginning in 1957, Ann Bannon&#x2019;s work defined lesbian fiction for the pre-Stonewall generation.

No good will come of your investigation," says Nanny Tess to David Ash, paranormal investigator, in this disappointing horror tale. An associate of the Psychical Research Institute, Ash visits Edbrook, a lonely mansion in the British countryside, at the behest of the Mariell siblings--Christina, Robert and Simon--playful, immature children in grown-up bodies, and their aunt, Nanny Tess, all of whom have seen ghosts and strange sights aplenty in their ancestral home. Ash, who has a reputation as a skeptic and debunker, wonders if a deliberate attempt to discredit him is taking place (or is his incipient alcoholism catching up with him?) when he follows a ghostly figure through the grounds to a small garden pond. He is pushed, held underwater--and sees a pale figure with open arms. . . . What are the ghastly secrets of Edbrook's history? Of Ash's? Only slightly buoyed by Ash's fond remembrances of seances past, Herbert's ( Sepulchre ) plot creaks under the weight of its padding, his dialogue as lifeless as his cliched characters.

More than thirty years later, his magnificent Dune chronicles have sold more copies than any other science fiction novels in history. This first book is set on the desert planet Arrakis, a world drawn as vividly and terrifyingly as any in literature. Dune begins the story of the man known as Maud'dib, a hero who will guide his great family in their ambition to bring about humankind's most ancient and unattainable dream to found the perfect society. Perhaps only J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings has as loyal a following as Frank Herbert's masterpiece. But no work of science fiction has had as profound an imaginative influence. <p>"Powerful, convincing, and most ingenious." (Robert Heinlein, master sci-fi writer)</p></p><p>This Hugo and Nebula Award winner tells the sweeping tale of a desert planet called Arrakis, the focus of an intricate power struggle in a byzantine interstellar empire. Arrakis is the sole source of Melange, the "spice of spices." Melange is necessary for interstellar travel and grants psychic powers and longevity, so whoever controls it wields great influence. <p> The troubles begin when stewardship of Arrakis is transferred by the Emperor from the Harkonnen Noble House to House Atreides. The Harkonnens don't want to give up their privilege, though, and through sabotage and treachery they cast young Duke Paul Atreides out into the planet's harsh environment to die. There he falls in with the Fremen, a tribe of desert dwellers who become the basis of the army with which he will reclaim what's rightfully his. Paul Atreides, though, is far more than just a usurped duke. He might be the end product of a very long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human; he might be a messiah. His struggle is at the center of a nexus of powerful people and events, and the repercussions will be felt throughout the Imperium. </p><p> <i>Dune</i> is one of the most famous science fiction novels ever written, and deservedly so.

Five sequels follow. <i>--Brooks Peck</i></p>13 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Barnstormer and the Lady: Aviation Legends Walter and Olive Ann Beech</h2><p>This is the story of Walter and Olive Ann Beech, the remarkable couple whose careers spanned virtually the entire history of American aviation. It is also the story of a marriage of opposites. Walter was a charming rascal, a hard-living barnstormer. Olive Ann was a shy small-town Kansas girl who hid that shyness behind an imperious manner and a backbone of steel. Together they founded Beech Aircraft Corp. in the teeth of the Great Depression and guided their company to fame and fortune. Their lives intersected with the giants of aviation: Amelia Earhart, Charles Lindbergh, Jimmy Doolittle, and many others. Their customers ranged from Arthur Godfrey to Lyndon B. Johnson, from Hollywood stars to Pentagon generals. Their company did much to transform Wichita, Kansas, from a dusty cow town to today's Aircraft Capital of the World. Even before Walter's shockingly early death, Olive Ann had quietly assumed the dominant role in their company. She was a woman in a man's world, one of the very first women in American history to lead a major corporation. But when male underlings attempted a corporate coup, she crushed it; when a big Eastern bank disrespected her, she dumped it. She died a millionaire many times over. <i>The Barnstormer and the Lady</i>, written by former Wall Street Journal reporter Dennis Farney, begins with an era when pilots still wore scarves and leather helmets and to fly was, quite literally, to defy death. It ends with aviation as a multi-billion-dollar industry. Bridging this colorful history were Walter and Olive Ann Beech, aristocrats of the air.</p><p></p><h2>Layover in Dubai</h2><p>The newest thriller from the author of <i>The Amateur Spy</i> and<i> The Prisoner of Guant�namo</i> (&#x201c;Worthy of sharing shelf space with the novels of John le Carr� and Ken Follett&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>USA Today)</i> is as dazzling as its setting.<br><br>Sam Keller has been enlisted by his V.P. for Corporate Security and Investigation to spy on another employee while they&#x2019;re traveling for the company.

He lives in Baltimore.3<br><br>When he was a boy, diving for pearls among sharks, and gambling with smugglers three times his age, Anwar Sharaf was rarely underestimated by his peers. Nowadays, in his fifties, people did it all the time. Especially Westerners, who needed only one look before writing him off as either incompetent or inconsequential.<br><br>Sharaf&#x2019;s police uniform was part of the problem&#x2014;green with epaulets and red piping, a canvas military belt, laced boots, a silly beret&#x2014;a getup that would have been right at home in some banana republic far across the waves. He accentuated the effect with a potbelly, a sloppy mustache, and the hangdog jowls of the long-suffering family man.<br><br>Glimpse him hunched over paperwork at his undersized desk and the word &#x201c;beleaguered&#x201d; came instantly to mind. So did &#x201c;inept&#x201d; and, possibly, &#x201c;corrupt.&#x201d; Because surely here was an underpaid fellow who would soon have his hand out, sighing and grumbling about this rule and that until you bribed him and were merrily on your way. A harmless nuisance, in other words. A scrap of local color to liven up your texts and postcards home: <i>Dumbest cop ever, LOL!</i><br><br>The moment Sharaf opened his mouth, impressions began to change. Fluent in English and Russian (his father, hiring tutors at the height of the Cold War, had hedged his bets), Sharaf had also picked up Hindi from the streets and Persian from the wharves. That left him in command of four of Dubai&#x2019;s main languages of commerce, with his native Arabic murmuring beneath them like an underground stream. His tutors had also schooled him in literature, economics, biology, philosophy&#x2014;the works. Throw in his seasons of instruction on the high seas at the age of thirteen&#x2014;a summer of pearling, an autumn of smuggling&#x2014;and he was arguably better equipped for intellectual combat than many of his contemporaries who had gone abroad to university.<br><br>Yet Sharaf usually held his fire. For one thing, why blow his cover? Enemies were more easily disarmed when they underestimated you. For another, he was accustomed to dismissive treatment, having endured it since the age of twenty-two, when he enraged his father by refusing to take a second wife even though his first one hadn&#x2019;t yet produced a child in two years of marriage. Thus did he break with a family tradition of Sharaf males taking multiple wives. Sharaf&#x2019;s father refused to acknowledge the move for what it was&#x2014;a gesture of rebellion by a young man determined to be &#x201c;modern.&#x201d; He instead scorned it as a craven surrender to foreign values and a domineering wife, and the berating continued without letup until his death six years later.<br><br>At that point, Sharaf&#x2019;s wife, Amina, took up the cudgel, even though by then she was producing offspring as bountifully as Dubai&#x2019;s new offshore wells were spouting oil. It wasn&#x2019;t out of malice. It was part of her job as an Emirati wife, which in those days included running a household with the tyrannical rigor of a ship&#x2019;s captain.<br><br>Little surprise, then, that as we join Sharaf late one weeknight he is stoically fending off the latest blow, grimacing as Amina says, &#x201c;You really can be a heartless imbecile, you know, when it comes to the welfare of your sons.&#x201d;<br><br>Amina had chosen a vulnerable moment for her new offensive. It was right before bedtime, when she knew that what Sharaf cherished most was a cool glass of camel&#x2019;s milk before climbing into bed with a book.<br><br>He was a man of uncomplicated tastes. Whereas Dubai&#x2019;s new elite favored art auctions, horse breeding, and an eclectic cuisine of, say, creamed leeks with shaved truffles, followed by poached Dover sole (which happened to be exactly what Sharaf&#x2019;s top boss, Brigadier Razzaq, had ordered that very night on the tab of a British banker), Sharaf preferred shopping malls, domino parlors, greasy mutton kebabs, and, his most recent discovery, sushi bars, which he treasured for their elemental taste of the sea.<br><br>In his reading he was far more adventuresome, a seeker of exotic riches from every hemisphere. He was particularly relishing tonight&#x2019;s offering&#x2014;Dostoevsky&#x2019;s <i>Crime and Punishment</i>, in the original Russian. A copy had arrived in the afternoon mail and awaited him on the bedside table. Sharaf was hungry for its insights, especially since certain Russians had lately been much on his mind. But now he would have to fight his way to sanctuary.<br><br>He set down his glass of milk with deliberation. He knew better than to answer hastily to such a skilled opponent. Early in their marriage Sharaf had enjoyed a clear advantage in these verbal contests, mostly because Amina&#x2019;s all-girl school had valued piety and deportment over rhetoric and quick thinking. But she had a sharp mind, and in raising their five children she had honed it on the whetstone of their daily stratagems and evasions. Sharaf, meanwhile, had steadily dulled his by going up against oafish criminals and sleepy desk sergeants, to the point that on the home front he was now sometimes overmatched.<br><br>&#x201c;So suddenly it&#x2019;s a hardship if Yousef can&#x2019;t fly business class to Paris?&#x201d; he answered.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s seven hours. He needs the legroom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s five-eight. He only wants it for the free booze.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anwar!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He drinks, you know. Ali said his son told him. Saw him in London once, in a pub. Maybe we should start checking his credit card<br>receipts.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As if you didn&#x2019;t already. And Ali&#x2019;s a shameless gossip. Yousef doesn&#x2019;t go near that sort of thing, and you know it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not here, at least. I&#x2019;m not saying he&#x2019;s a fool, just a profane opportunist.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Says the Muslim who loves bacon and spareribs.&#x201d;<br><br>The pork story again. A mistake to have told her. It had slipped out the week before, while he was sharing fond memories of a boyhood tutor: Gregor, half bear and half man, a roaring Muscovite who had served bountiful lunches with his verb conjugations and Euclidean geometry. The best part of those meals was the most succulent goat meat Sharaf had ever eaten. Deliciously fatty, redolent of smoke. Gregor had explained that it was an exotic breed, imported from the motherland. The feasts continued until the day Sharaf described the pleasures of this &#x201c;imported goat&#x201d; to his skeptical father, who quickly got to the bottom of things. The boy got a beating for his gullibility, not to mention a skinny new tutor who served only bread, olives, and hummus. But his memories of the flavor were still so vivid that he sometimes slipped into the forbidden pork sections of the local Spinneys supermarket, justifying his unauthorized presence among the foreigners with a furtive wave of police credentials, as if he might be checking for narcotics among the slab-cut bacon and inch-thick chops. He never bought any. A glance was sufficient. Even now his mouth was watering, so he conceded the point and moved on.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, let him fly first class. But where&#x2019;s he staying, and for how long?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some five-star hotel, no doubt.

Nor would he mention their third son, Rahim, who was living in the house next door, scandalously single at the age of twenty-nine. Or even Salim, the eldest, who also made his home within the high stucco walls of the Sharaf family compound. Salim inhabited the largest of the family&#x2019;s houses, yet he was constantly agitating for a bigger one. Salim needed more room because during the previous year he had symbolically joined forces with Sharaf&#x2019;s dead father by taking a second wife. You could now hear the family arguments from the street. Salim&#x2019;s growing brood had become as noisy and chaotic as a clan of Bedouins and all their goats.<br><br>Only on the subject of their daughter, Laleh, were Amina and Sharaf generally in agreement, mostly because she still lived under their roof.

But here she was, like most of the other lost souls who&#x2019;d come West, looking for something better, and in her case, wishing for a second chance. She knew the odds were against her, but it didn&#x2019;t stop her from yearning. <p>There was a ritual from her childhood that she performed each evening as the sun was going down. She would step out onto the balcony off her bedroom, lift her face to the heavens to search for the Evening Star, then stand quietly in the growing shadows and listen for the call of the whippoorwill. </p><p>It came from a memory of her mother who had died when she was ten. Always, she was sitting in her mother&#x2019;s lap outside their clapboard house watching night fall over the land. They would sit on the front step with their bare feet planted firmly in the still warm dirt while enjoying the first cool breezes of evening. As they sat, they would search for the first star and wait for the whippoorwill&#x2019;s call. Her mother had told her the bird was searching for its mate, but Letty had yet to meet a man who was worth the call. However, the memory was one of the few good ones she had left. Two years after her mother&#x2019;s untimely death, her father was killed by a Comanche hunting party. Letty survived by hiding in a hollowed out badger hole. That was the last time fate showed her any kindness. At twenty-seven, she was well past the marrying age and nearly too used up to care. Yet, she didn&#x2019;t stop wishing, and she didn&#x2019;t stop dreaming about a different sort of life. </p><p>Then one day, something happened in Lizard Flats that had never happened before. Word began to spread throughout the area that a real preacher from back East was coming to perform a wedding. The news set off a whole series of unforeseen events. Caught up in the excitement of the occasion, Letty couldn&#x2019;t help but think that a change was coming for her, too.</p>Whippoorwill is a tale filled with emotion &#x2013; set in a place rich with color and even more colorful characters. From the bawdy to the banal &#x2013; from the poor to the poignant. And all because of a less than pious preacher and a prostitute yearning for something more, the tapestry of these peoples lives become interwoven, culminating with marryings to buryings and all that comes between.</p><h2>Plunder Of The Sun (Hard Case Crime)</h2><p>Al Colby is submerged in a world of betrayal and murder when he agrees to smuggle a package from Chile and Peru, a package that contains an ancient treasure map, making him the target of relentless gunmen and fortunehunters.

That was former New Republic editor Andrew Sullivan's first public statement about his HIV diagnosis. Speaking to heterosexual and homosexual audiences alike, this book is about the first steps in that journey of survival.<br><br>If Sullivan's acclaimed first book, <i>Virtually Normal</i>, was about politics, this long-awaited sequel is about life. In a memoir in the form of three essays, Sullivan asks hard questions about his own life and others'. Can the practice of friendship ever compensate for a life without love? Is sex at war or at peace with spirituality? Can faith endure the randomness of death? Is homosexuality genetic or environmental?<br><br>Love Undetectable, then, refers to many things: to a virus that, for many, has become "undetectable" in the bloodstream thanks to new drugs, and to the failed search for love and intimacy that helped spread it; to the love of God, which in times of plague seems particularly hard to find and understand; to a sexual orientation long pathologized and denied any status as an equal form of human love; and to the love between friends, a love ignored when it isn't demeaned, and obscured by the more useful imperatives of family and society.<br><br>In a work destined to be as controversial as his first book, Sullivan takes on religious authorities and gay activists; talks candidly about his own promiscuity and search for love; revisits Freud in the origins of homosexuality; and makes one of the more memorable modern cases for elevating the virtue of friendship over the satisfactions of love. Scholarly, impassioned, wide-ranging, and embattled, Love Undetectable is a book that is ultimately not about homosexuality or plague, but about humanity and mortality.</p><p>In November of 1996, Andrew Sullivan wrote an article in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> entitled "When Plagues End" in which he claimed that then-new treatments for the HIV retrovirus had signaled the end of AIDS. The article drew much criticism from activists and health professionals; in <i>Love Undetectable</i>, Sullivan--who is himself living with HIV--elaborates upon his argument, embellishing and embroidering it with nuance and context to make it at once more personal and universal. His thinking about AIDS leads him to a philosophical contemplation on the "causes" of homosexuality in which he discards all of the negative psychological theories, then rejects genetics as well. In the following essay on the nature of friendship and love, Sullivan finds his voice and true topic--using "friendship" as a lens through which he can wed his autobiographical musings and speculative theories on how we, as mortal humans struggling against time and the body, can make sense of the world. <p> Always provocative--the chapters on the plague will still rankle those who see AIDS as an ever-present and growing danger--<i>Love Undetectable</i> proves that Sullivan has a voice and a heart that can reach across the borders of experience and politics. <i>--Michael Bronski</i></p>"He wants to see same-sex love fully accepted as a dignified form of human relations...<br>This book can only help the cause"<br>-Andrew Delbanco, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p>"On display here are all of the author's many strengths--a compelling, poetic prose style, some keen observations on faith, an evocative retelling of his friendship with a man felled by AIDS"<br>--Liz Galst, <i>Boston Globe</i></p><p>"Love Undetectable proves that Sullivan has a voice and a heart that can reach across <br>the borders of experience and politics"<br>--Michael Bronski, Amazon.com</p></p><h2>The Consultant</h2><p>CompWare is in serious trouble after a promised merger falls through, so they do what other businesses have done to bolster their public image: they hire a consulting firm to review and streamline their business practices.<br><br>But there's something strange about the firm they hire--more specifically, the quirky gentleman who arrives to supervise the project: Mr. Patoff, tall and thin and wearing a bow tie, and with an odd smile that never quite reaches his eyes.<br><br>In his first interactions, the consultant asks a few inappropriate questions, and generally seems a nuisance. Over time, Patoff gains more power, to the point where he seems to be running the whole company. He enacts arbitrary and invasive changes to office protocol. He places cameras all over the building, making workers paranoid; he calls employees at all hours of the night, visits some of their homes and menaces their families. <br><br>People who defy the consultant get fired... or worse. <br><br>They soon realize they're not just fighting for their jobs: They're fighting for their lives.<br><br>The Consultant is a biting workplace satire, with the horrific touches only Bentley Little could provide.</p><p><b>Bentley Little</b>&nbsp;is the author of numerous novels, short stories, articles, essays, and reviews. After earning a BA in communications and an MA in English, Little sold his soul and abandoned all artistic integrity, working for eight years as a bureaucrat for a midsized city in Orange County, California.

Detailing the events leading up to the Whitechapel killings and the cover-up that followed, FROM HELL is a meditation on the mind of a madman whose savagery and violence gave birth to the 20th century. The serialized story, presented in its entirety in this volume, has garnered widespread attention from critics and scholars. Often regarded as one of the most significant graphic novels ever published, FROM HELL combines meticulous research with educated speculation, resulting in a masterpiece of historical fiction both compelling and terrifying. This new edition, which has been completely re-mastered, is certainly the finest edition of the book produced to date.</p><p>The mad, shaggy genius of the comics world dips deeply into the well of history and pulls up a cup filled with blood in <i>From Hell</i>. Alan Moore did a couple of Ph.D.'s worth of research into the Whitechapel murders for this copiously annotated collection of the independently published series. The web of facts, opinion, hearsay, and imaginative invention draws the reader in from the first page. Eddie Campbell's scratchy ink drawings evoke a dark and dirty Victorian London and help to humanize characters that have been caricatured into obscurity for decades. Moore, having decided that the evidence best fits the theory of a Masonic conspiracy to cover up a scandal involving Victoria's grandson, goes to work telling the story with relish from the point of view of the victims, the chief inspector, and the killer--the Queen's physician. His characterization is just as vibrant as Campbell's; even the minor characters feel fully real. Looking more deeply than most, the author finds in the "great work" of the Ripper a ritual magic working intended to give birth to the 20th century in all its horrid glory. Maps, characters, and settings are all as accurate as possible, and while the reader might not ultimately agree with Moore and Campbell's thesis, <i>From Hell</i> is still a great work of literature. <i>--Rob Lightner</i><b>Alan Moore</b>&nbsp;is widely regarded as the best and most influential writer in the history of comics. His seminal works include&nbsp;<i>Miracleman&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Watchmen</i>, for which he won the coveted Hugo Award. Never one to limit himself in form or content, Moore has also published novels,&nbsp;<i>Voice of the Fire&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Jerusalem</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;an epic poem,&nbsp;<i>The Mirror of Love.&nbsp;</i>Four of his ground-breaking graphic novels&#x2014;<i>From Hell</i>,&nbsp;<i>Watchmen</i>,&nbsp;<i>V for Vendetta</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i>&#x2014;have been adapted to the silver screen.

In Jazz Modernism, one of our finest cultural historians provides the answer.<br><br>Alfred Appel, author of <b>The Annotated Lolita</b> ("superb . . . full of vigor, gems, and stratagems"--Vladimir Nabokov), compares the layering of sex, vitality, and the vernacular in jazz with the paper collages of Picasso, and the vital mix of high and low culture found in Joyce. He shows how the musical construct of jazz was pared down by the masters as sculpture was in Calder's hands or prose in Hemingway's. He makes clear how Armstrong and Waller tore apart and rebuilt Tin Pan Alley material in the way that modernists in the visual arts arrived at wood assemblage and scrap-metal sculpture. He enables us to see that Ellington's "jungle" style was as un-primitive as Brancusi's self-conscious Africanesque sculpture. And along the way, he "recalls" live jazz perform-ances during the 1950s by Armstrong and John Coltrane, among others, and the night Charlie Parker played to a visibly thrilled Igor Stravinsky at Birdland.<br><br>Making connections as illuminating as they are unexpected, Alfred Appel gives us a brilliant new way of understanding jazz.</p><p>Winner of the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award for Best Book on Popular Music 2003&#34;[Jazz Modernism uses] definitive examples of early to mid-twentieth-century literary art to establish the place of classic jazz in the great modernist tradition of the arts. . . .

Will her desire for revenge overwhelm her natural urge to love?</p></p><p><b>Kat Martin&#x2019;s</b> bestselling novels include <i>Nothing But Velvet, Innocence Undone</i>, and the Raines of Wind Canyon Series&#x2015;<i>Against the Wind, Against the Fire</i>, and <i>Against the Law</i>. Her book <i>Silk and Steel</i> was nominated for a RITA Award. She is a graduate of the University of California, where she majored in Anthropology and History, a background that helped to develop her interest in the past. "I love anything old," she says. "I especially love to visit the settings for my books. My husband and I often stay in out-of-the-way inns and houses built in times past. It's fun and it gives a wonderful sense of a bygone era." Before becoming a writer, Martin was a real estate broker. She lives with her husband, author Larry Jay Martin, in Missoula, Montana.Dominic Edgemont's reputation in late Georgian British society is rather tarnished: aside from rumors of womanizing, he's said to be part gypsy--a rumor that Catherine Barrington, Countess of Arondale, discovers to be true after she is kidnapped by scheming relatives, passed from hand to hand and finally bought by Dominic who is visiting the gypsy band where he was raised. A clash of wills follows as Dominic tries to seduce Catherine out of the virginity she has so far managed to preserve; as fate would have it, the two, not surprisingly, fall in love and he succeeds. Martin's tale is a good one with some reservations, one being an unnecessary scene in which Catherine provokes Dominic into beating her to the delight of the gypsy camp. Early on, Martin is careless with certain genre conventions almost to the point of comedy: Edgemont's title (Lord Nightwyck, heir to the Marquess of Gravenwold) overhints at the diabolical and Martin's description of Catherine as an atypical beauty--with "eyes . . . a little too large and a little too green, and her lips were a little too full"--makes one wonder at the era's ideal. Although well-intentioned, Martin ( Captain's Bride ) also sometimes buys into stereotypes about gypsies. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>His Holiness</h2><p>With the same meticulous reporting skills and narrative excitement that went into <i>All the President's Men</i> and <i>The Final Days,</i> journalists Carl Bernstein and Marco Politi provide an astonishing look at Pope John Paul II--the foremost political figure of our time. In their research, Bernstein and Politi have had unprecedented access to rare sources of information in Rome, Washington, and Moscow, including formerly top-secret Soviet files. Through these fascinating documents, <i>His Holiness</i> allows the reader a previously impossible glimpse inside the inner workings of the Soviet hierarchy, and shows how the Soviets recognized the serious threat John Paul II posed to their survival--even a the start of his papacy. Startling Politburo minutes show Brezhnev, Andropov, and other key figures heatedly discussing at length how to handle the pope--even within days of the nearly successful assassination attempt. Yet, John Paul II would come to dominate his era much as Churchill dominated his, ultimately fashioning an alliance with Reagan to reverse Yalta and hasten the demise of Communism.<br><br>Surprisingly, it was not for his political instincts that he rose through church ranks; rather he is the first prelate in history to rise to the papacy based on his work in the field of sexual morality--as writer, researcher, and counselor to young couples.<br><br><i>His Holiness</i> succeeds where other studies have failed at capturing the humanness of John Paul II, and it explains the inner mysteries of the man who has set the Catholic Church on an unmistakable course that has both divided and uplifted the billion members of his church. What also emerges is the unknown story of a boy who turned to God after losing all his closest family members and whose unbelievable destiny was shaped by a youth in the midst of Nazi (and later Communist) Europe. However controversial, Pope John Paul II's iron will and strong convictions have made him the great moral leader of our time.</p><p>Two veteran reporters, American Carl Bernstein (co-author of <b>All the President's Men</b>) and Italian Marco Politi have teamed up to present the case that Pope John Paul II worked closely with American political figures to cause the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe.

Against her friends' better judgment, she's taken up swimming in the Thames, and she feels closer than ever to Detective Mark Joesbury, despite his involvement in a complicated undercover case. For the first time in her life, as she recovers from the trauma of the last few months, Lacey begins to feel almost happy.</p><p>Then, at dawn one hot summer morning while swimming down the river, Lacey finds the body of a shrouded young woman in the water. She assumes it was chance&#x2015;after all, she's recently joined the marine policing unit, and she knows how many dead bodies are pulled out of the river every year, most the result of tragic accidents. But further investigation leads her policing team to suspect the woman's body was deliberately left for Lacey to find. Lacey's no longer a homicide detective, but as she begins to notice someone keeping a strangely close eye on her, she's inexorably drawn into the investigation.</p><p>Award-winning author Sharon Bolton has once again crafted a tightly plotted, utterly unpredictable thriller around one of the most compelling characters in crime fiction today, intensely private London police officer Lacey Flint, whose penchant for keeping secrets is only matched by her determination to uncover those of others.</p></p><p>SHARON BOLTON is a Mary Higgins Clark Award winner and an ITW Thriller Award, CWA Gold Dagger and Barry Award nominee. She lives near London, England. Sharon Bolton was previously published as S.J. Bolton.Still unsettled by her experiences as a detective constable, quick-witted Lacey Flint, last seen in Lost (2013), returns to work, she&#x2019;s now assigned to London&#x2019;s river police. While swimming in the Thames, she comes across the bloated corpse of young woman, wrapped in linen, who turns out to be from a particular region of Afghanistan, which leads Lacey to recall her rescue of another young woman, from the same region, who was smuggled into London some months before. Lacey soon finds herself working alongside her old detective colleagues, her willful disregard for procedure driving her superior nuts. Thanks to Lacey, more bodies are recovered from the Thames, and Lacey once again lands in the middle of a particularly baffling mystery. The obstinate yet emotionally vulnerable Lacey, who made her first appearance in Now You See Me (2011), remains a strong character, but this time her fans will need a bit of patience to negotiate the plethora of sometimes confusing twists and turns. --Stephanie Zvirin</p><h2>The Discworld Graphic Novels: The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Discworld is more complicated and satisfactory than Oz.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;A.S.

An unmatched evocation of the exodus from Paris after the German invasion of 1940, and of life under the Nazi occupation, it was written by the esteemed French novelist Ir�ne N�mirovsky as events unfolded around her. This haunting masterpiece has been hailed by European critics as a <b>War and Peace</b><i> </i>for the Second World War.<br><br>Though she conceived the book as a five-part work (based on the form of Beethoven&#x2019;s Fifth Symphony), Ir�ne N�mirovsky was able to write only the first two parts, <i>Storm in June </i>and <i>Dolce</i>, before she was arrested in July 1942. She died in Auschwitz the following month. The manuscript was saved by her young daughter Denise; it was only decades later that Denise learned that what she had imagined was her mother&#x2019;s journal was in fact an invaluable work of art.<br><br><i>Storm in June</i> takes place in the tumult of the evacuation from Paris in 1940, just before the arrival of the invading German army. It moves vividly between different levels of society&#x2013;from the wealthy P�ricand family, whose servants pack up their possessions for them, to a group of orphans from the 16th arrondissement<b> </b>escaping in a military truck. N�mirovsky&#x2019;s immense canvas includes deserting soldiers and terrified secretaries, cynical bank directors and hapless priests, egotistical writers and hardscrabble prostitutes&#x2013;all thrown together in a chaotic attempt to escape the capital. Moving between them chapter by chapter, this thrilling novel describes a journey hampered and in some cases abandoned because of confusion, shelling, rumour, lack of supplies, bad luck and ordinary human weakness. Cars break down or are stolen; relatives are forgotten; friends are divided; but there are also moments of love and charity. Throughout, whether depicting saintly forbearance or the basest selfishness, <i>Storm in June </i>neither sweetens nor demonizes its characters; unsentimentally, with stunning perceptiveness, N�mirovsky shows the complexities that mean no-one is simply a hero or villain. <br><br>The second volume, <i>Dolce</i>, is set in the German-occupied village of Bussy. Again, N�mirovsky switches seamlessly between social strata, from tenant farmers to the local aristocracy. The focus, however, is on the delicate, secret love affair between a German soldier and the French woman in whose house he has been billeted; the passion, doubts and deceits of their burgeoning relationship echo the complex mixture of hostility and acceptance felt by the occupied community as a whole. N�mirovsky is amazingly sensitive in her depiction of changing, often contradictory emotions, but her attention to the personal is matched by her sharp-eyed discussion of small-town life and the politics of occupation. In this myth-dissolving book, the French villagers see the Germans as oppressive warriors, but also as handsome young men, and occupation does nothing to remedy the condescension and envy that bedevil relations between rich and poor. <br><b><br></b>Quite apart from the astonishing story of its survival, <b>Suite Fran�aise</b> is a novel of genius and lasting artistic value. Subtle, often fiercely ironic, and deeply compassionate, it is both a piercing record of its time and a humane, profoundly moving novel.</p><p>Ir�ne N�mirovsky was born in Kiev in 1903 into a successful banking family. Trapped in Moscow by the Russian Revolution, she and her family fled first to a village in Finland, and eventually to France, where she attended the Sorbonne. <br><br>Ir�ne N�mirovsky achieved early success as a writer: her first novel, <i>David Golder</i>, published when she was twenty-six, was a sensation. By 1937 she had published nine further books and <i>David Golder </i>had been made into a film; she and her husband Michel Epstein, a bank executive, moved in fashionable social circles. <br><br>When the Germans occupied France in 1940, she moved with her husband and two small daughters, aged 5 and 13, from Paris to the comparative safety of Issy-L&#x2019;Ev�que. It was there that she secretly began writing <b>Suite Fran�aise</b>. Though her family had converted to Catholicism, she was arrested on 13 July, 1942, and interned in the concentration camp at Pithiviers. She died in Auschwitz in August of that year.<b>1<br><br>War <br><br></b>Hot, thought the Parisians. The warm air of spring. It was night, they were at war and there was an air raid. But dawn was near and the war far away. The first to hear the hum of the siren were those who couldn&#x2019;t sleep&#x2014;the ill and bedridden, mothers with sons at the front, women crying for the men they loved. To them it began as a long breath, like air being forced into a deep sigh. It wasn&#x2019;t long before its wailing filled the sky. It came from afar, from beyond the horizon, slowly, almost lazily. Those still asleep dreamed of waves breaking over pebbles, a March storm whipping the woods, a herd of cows trampling the ground with their hooves, until finally sleep was shaken off and they struggled to open their eyes, murmuring, &#x201c;Is it an air raid?&#x201d;<br><br>The women, more anxious, more alert, were already up, although some of them, after closing the windows and shutters, went back to bed. The night before &#x2014; Monday, 3 June &#x2014; bombs had fallen on Paris for the first time since the beginning of the war. Yet everyone remained calm. Even though the reports were terrible, no one believed them. No more so than if victory had been announced. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t understand what&#x2019;s happening,&#x201d; people said.<br><br>They had to dress their children by torchlight. Mothers lifted small, warm, heavy bodies into their arms: &#x201c;Come on, don&#x2019;t be afraid, don&#x2019;t cry.&#x201d; An air raid. All the lights were out, but beneath the clear, golden June sky, every house, every street was visible. As for the Seine, the river seemed to absorb even the faintest glimmers of light and reflect them back a hundred times brighter, like some multifaceted mirror. Badly blacked-out windows, glistening rooftops, the metal hinges of doors all shone in the water. There were a few red lights that stayed on longer than the others, no one knew why, and the Seine drew them in, capturing them and bouncing them playfully on its waves. From above, it could be seen flowing along, as white as a river of milk. It guided the enemy planes, some people thought. Others said that couldn&#x2019;t be so. In truth, no one really knew anything. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying in bed,&#x201d; sleepy voices murmured, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not scared.&#x201d; &#x201c;All the same, it just takes one . . .&#x201d; the more sensible replied.<br><br>Through the windows that ran along the service stairs in new apartment blocks, little flashes of light could be seen descending: the people living on the sixth floor were fleeing the upper storeys; they held their torches in front of them, in spite of the regulations. &#x201c;Do you think I want to fall on my face on the stairs! Are you coming, Emile?&#x201d; Everyone instinctively lowered their voices as if the enemy&#x2019;s eyes and ears were everywhere. One after another, doors slammed shut. In the poorer neighbourhoods there was always a crowd in the M�tro, or the foul-smelling shelters. The wealthy simply went to sit with the concierge, straining to hear the shells bursting and the explosions that meant bombs were falling, their bodies as tense as frightened animals in dark woods as the hunter gets closer. Though the poor were just as afraid as the rich, and valued their lives just as much, they were more sheeplike: they needed one another, needed to link arms, to groan or laugh together.<br><br>Day was breaking. A silvery blue light slid over the cobblestones, over the parapets along the quayside, over the towers of Notre-Dame. Bags of sand were piled halfway up all the important monuments, encircling Carpeaux&#x2019;s dancers on the fa�ade of the Opera House, silencing the Marseillaise on the Arc de Triomphe.<br><br>Still at some distance, great guns were firing; they drew nearer, and every window shuddered in reply. In hot rooms with blacked-out windows, children were born, and their cries made the women forget the sound of sirens and war. To the dying, the barrage of gunfire seemed far away, without any meaning whatsoever, just one more element in that vague, menacing whisper that washes over those on the brink of death. Children slept peacefully, held tight against their mothers&#x2019; sides, their lips making sucking noises, like little lambs. Street sellers&#x2019; carts lay abandoned, full of fresh flowers.<br><br>The sun came up, fiery red, in a cloudless sky. A shell was fired, now so close to Paris that from the top of every monument birds rose into the sky. Great black birds, rarely seen at other times, stretched out their pink-tinged wings. Beautiful fat pigeons cooed; swallows wheeled; sparrows hopped peacefully in the deserted streets. Along the Seine each poplar tree held a cluster of little brown birds who sang as loudly as they could. From deep beneath the ground came the muffled noise everyone had been waiting for, a sort of three-tone fanfare. The air raid was over.<br><b>2</b> <br><br>In the P�ricand household they listened in shocked silence to the evening news on the radio, but no one passed comment on the latest developments. The P�ricands were a cultivated family: their traditions, their way of thinking, their middle-class, Catholic background, their ties with the Church (their eldest son, Philippe P�ricand, was a priest), all these things made them mistrustful of the government of France. On the other hand, Monsieur P�ricand&#x2019;s position as curator of one of the country&#x2019;s national museums bound them to an administration that showered its faithful with honours and financial rewards.<br><br>A cat held a little piece of bony fish tentatively between its sharp teeth. He was afraid to swallow it, but he couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to spit it out either.<br><br>Madame P�ricand finally decided that only a male mind could explain with clarity such strange, serious events. Neither her husband nor her eldest son was at home: her husband was dining with friends, her son was not in Paris. Charlotte P�ricand, who ruled the family&#x2019;s daily life with an iron hand (whether it was managing the household, her children&#x2019;s education or her husband&#x2019;s career), was not in the habit of seeking anyone&#x2019;s opinion. But this was of a different order. She needed a voice of authority to tell her what to believe. Once pointed in the right direction, there would be no stopping her. Even if given absolute proof she was mistaken, she would reply with a cold, condescending smile, &#x201c;My father said so . . . My husband is very well-informed.&#x201d; And she would make a dismissive little gesture with her gloved hand.<br><br>She took pride in her husband&#x2019;s position (she herself would have preferred a more domestic lifestyle, but following the example of our Dear Saviour, each of us has his cross to bear). She had come home between appointments to oversee her children&#x2019;s studies, the baby&#x2019;s bottles and the servants&#x2019; work, but she didn&#x2019;t have time to take off her hat and coat. For as long as the P�ricand children could remember, their mother was always ready to go out, armed with hat and white gloves. (Since she was thrifty, her mended gloves had the faint smell of stain remover, a reminder of their passage through the dry-cleaners.)<br><br>As soon as she had come in this evening, she had gone to stand in front of the radio in the drawing room. Her clothes were black, her hat a divine little creation in fashion that season, decorated with three flowers and topped with a silk pom-pom. Beneath it, her face was pale and anguished, emphasising the marks of age and fatigue. She was forty-seven years old and had five children. You would have thought, to look at her, that God had intended her to be a redhead. Her skin was extremely delicate, lined by the passing years. Freckles were dotted over her strong, majestic nose. The expression in her green eyes was as sharp as a cat&#x2019;s. At the last minute, however, it seemed that Providence had wavered, or decided that a shock of red hair would not be appropriate, neither to Madame P�ricand&#x2019;s irreproachable morals nor to her social status, so she had been given mousy brown hair, which she was losing by the handful since she&#x2019;d had her last child. Monsieur P�ricand was a man of great discipline: his religious scruples prohibited a number of pleasures and his concern for his reputation kept him away from places of ill repute. The youngest P�ricand child was only two, and between Father Philippe and the baby, there were three other children, not counting the ones Madame P�ricand discreetly referred to as the &#x201c;three accidents&#x201d;: babies she had carried almost to term before losing them, so that three times their mother had been on the verge of death.<br><br>The drawing room, where the radio was now playing, was enormous and well-proportioned, with four windows overlooking the Boulevard Delessert. It was furnished in traditional style, with large armchairs and settees upholstered in golden yellow. Next to the balcony, the elder Monsieur P�ricand sat in his wheelchair. He was an invalid whose advancing age meant that he sometimes lapsed back into childhood and only truly returned to his right mind when discussing his fortune, which was considerable (he was a P�ricand-Malt�te, heir of the Malt�te family of Lyon). But the war, with its trials and tribulations, no longer affected him. He listened, indifferent, steadily nodding his beautiful silvery beard. The children stood in a semi-circle behind their mother, the youngest in his nanny&#x2019;s arms. Nanny had three sons of her own at the front. She had brought the little boy downstairs to say goodnight to his family and took advantage of her brief entry into the drawing room to listen anxiously to what they were saying on the radio.<br><br>The door was slightly ajar and Madame P�ricand could sense the presence of the other servants outside. Madeleine, the maid, was so beside herself with worry that she came right up to the doorway. To Madame P�ricand, such a breach of the normal rules seemed a frightening indication of things to com...</p><h2>Zulu Victory: The Epic of Isandlwana and the Cover-up</h2><p>The battle of Isandlwana - a great Zulu victory - was one of the worst defeats ever to befall a British Army. At noon on January 22nd, 1879, a British camp, garrisoned by over 1700 troops, was attacked and overwhelmed by 20,000 Zulu warriors. The defeat of the British, armed with the most modern weaponry of the day, caused disbelief and outrage throughout Queen Victoria&#39;s England. The obvious culprit for the blunder was Lieutenant General Lord Chelmsford, the defeated commander. Appearing to respond to the outcry, he ordered a court of inquiry. But there followed a carefully conducted cover-up in which Chelmsford found a scapegoat in the dead - most notably, in Colonel Anthony Durnford. The popular conception of the Anglo-Zulu War is that of a conflict between British redcoats and Zulu Warriors. It is seldom realized that over 60% of Chelmsford&#39;s army was composed of black auxiliaries, and that the cavalry mostly comprised colonial settlers. Zulu Victory: The Epic of Isandlwana and the Cover-Up traces the history of the Zulu kingdom and its British neighbors, the Colony of Natal. It also details the composition of both armies from individual Zulu regiments to the tribesmen of the Natal Native Horse who fought on the side of the British. Using source material ranging from the Royal Windsor Archives to the oral history passed down to the present Zulu inhabitants of Isandlwana, the authors shed new light upon this famous Zulu victory in all its bravery and horror, and the scandal that followed.</p><p>Ron Lock, author of Blood on the Painted Mountain (1853672017), and Peter Quantrill spent over three years researching and traveling in the footsteps of both armies.This is an important book in the genre of the Anglo-Zulu War. The authors - Ron Lock &amp; Peter Quantrill - through meticulous research, have recreated the events surrounding the shocking military defeat suffered by the British army at Isandlwana on the 22nd of January, 1879, at the hands of the warriors of the Zulu king, Cetshwayo. The Zulu campaign was planned by Ntshingwayo - a superb commander - who out thought, and out fought the British commander, Lord Chelmsford. What is remarkable, the authors point out, is that the British were armed with modern weapons, such as breechloading rifles, machine guns, cannons and rocket batteries, whilst the Zulu warriors were armed with a short stabbing spear, and a cowhide shield. And yet, the Zulu commander - Ntshingwayo - knowing exactly what his warriors faced, nevertheless devised an efficient and ruthless military plan that saw Lord Chelmsford fatally split his force, and through the use of the Zulu formation of the 'horns of the buffolo', descended upon the British camp at Isandlwana, destroying it in around 2 hours of fighting, that saw the British force destroyed, (just 50 Europeans managed to flee to neighbouring Natal), and Chelmsford's military reputation in tatters. The hardback (2002) edition, contains 336 numbered pages and is comprised of 9 chapters, separated into 3 sections: Part One - The Conflict. Part Two - The Battle. Part Three - The Cover-up. There are 3 appendices, and the book contains very good pictures and illustrations. The authors approach this battle from the perspective of a Zulu victory, rather than the usual approach of British defeat. This is to counter the search for excuses for the British defeat - excuses that usually evolve around a sense of incomprehension and scape goating - rather than admitting that the result was the consequence of superb Zulu planning and execution. After the battle, Lord Chelmsford and his immediate staff conspired to hide the truth of the chain of events that led to the disaster itself. Through clear research and analysis, the authors demonstrate that the blame for the defeat resides firmly at Lord Chelmsford's door, and that he, as over-all British military commander in the field, was responsible for underestimating the Zulu capacity to make war, and that this inadequate assessment led to the deaths of hundreds of men under his command. This book pays tribute to the Zulu people, and exposes imperial hypocracy and the under-belly of colonial rule. One very unique attribute to this book is that it carries an Introduction, written by Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, MP. This gentleman explains that the Zulus never saw the British as 'enemies', and that the king - Cetshwayo - did not understand why British forces had invaded his homeland, or why the British and Zulus had to fight, when previously, very good relations had existed between the two peoples. A fine book of much academic merit. --ShiDaDao Ph.D<br><br>The Battle of Isandlwana was by far the worst defeat ever suffered by the British Army at the hands of a Native Force, How could it have happened? A British Army which had the most up to date weapons including Artillery completely destroyed by a native force using spears and shields. This Book attempts to answer this question and does a good job of it to. As a member of a re-enactment group called the 'Die-Hard Company' who turn out as soldiers of the 24th Foot and went to South Africa in January 1999 - We hope to go again in January 2004 - I often get asked questions about what happened Isandlwana and if I can reccommend any books about the battle. The Authors of this work have really worked hard to give a accurate and fair account of what happened at Isandlwana and how after the batttle the British Commanders tried to pass the blame for the defeat from themselves to others who were conveniently dead. The other strong point of this book is the authors attempt to end the debate on the ammo supply faliure at Isandlwana. This subject has been a place of real augument for years with historians split right down the middle about it. Ron Lock and Peter Quantrill examine the debate and give a very good account of what probably happened although I doubt it will end the debate. Overall this is a really good read and comes highly reccommended. As a last point I often get asked if the British learned the lesson of Isandlwana. The answer is NO! for less than a year later in Afganistan the British suffered another defeat which was almost an exact copy of Isandlwana - It's name? MAIWAND! --A G.

On what is arguably the most influential show in television history, she has gotten her guests&#x2014;often the biggest celebrities in the world&#x2014;to bare their love lives, explore their painful pasts, admit their transgressions, reveal their pleasures, and explore their demons. In turn, Oprah has repeatedly allowed her audience to share in her own life story, opening up about the sexual abuse in her past and discussing her romantic relationships, her weight problems, her spiritual beliefs, her charitable donations, and her strongly held views on the state of the world. <br><br>After a quarter of a century of the Oprah-ization of America, can there be any more secrets left to reveal? Yes. Because Oprah has met her match. <br><br>Kitty Kelley has, over the same period of time, fearlessly and relentlessly investigated and written about the world&#x2019;s most revered icons: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Reagan, England&#x2019;s Royal Family, and the Bush dynasty. In her #1 bestselling biographies, she has exposed truths and exploded myths to uncover the real human beings that exist behind their manufactured facades. <br><br>Turning her reportorial sights on Oprah, Kelley has now given us an unvarnished look at the stories Oprah&#x2019;s told and the life she&#x2019;s led. Kelley has talked to Oprah&#x2019;s closest family members and business associates. She has obtained court records, birth certificates, financial and tax records, and even copies of Oprah&#x2019;s legendary (and punishing) confidentiality agreements. She has probed every aspect of Oprah Winfrey&#x2019;s life, and it is as if she&#x2019;s written the most extraordinary segment of The Oprah Winfrey Show ever filmed&#x2014;one in which Oprah herself is finally and fully revealed. <br><br>There is a case to be made, and it is certainly made in this book, that Oprah Winfrey is an important, and even great, figure of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. But there is also a case to be made that even greatness needs to be examined and put under a microscope. Fact must be separated from myth, truth from hype. Kitty Kelley has made that separation, showing both sides of Oprah as they have never been shown before. In doing so she has written a psychologically perceptive and meticulously researched book that will surprise and thrill everyone who reads it.</p><p>Kitty Kelley is the internationally acclaimed bestselling author of <em>Jackie Oh!</em>; <em>Elizabeth Taylor: The Last Star</em>; Hi<em>s Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra</em>; <em>Nancy Reagan: The Unauthorized Biography</em>; <em>The Royals</em>; and <em>The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty</em>. The last four titles were all #1 on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list. Kelley has been honored by her peers with such awards as the Outstanding Author Award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors for her &#x201c;courageous writing on popular cul�ture,&#x201d; the Philip M. Stern Award for her &#x201c;outstanding service to writers and the writing profession,&#x201d; the Medal of Merit from the Lotos Club of New York City, and the 2005 PEN Oakland Literary Censorship Award.

She lives in Washington, D.C., with her physician husband, Jonathan Zucker.OPRAH is an unauthorized biography by one of the most widely read pop biographers of our era. Kitty Kelley conducted more than 800 interviews during four years of research on her subject. Kelley walks us through Oprah Winfrey&#39;s life--from her humble beginnings to her rise in TV and her bad choices surrounding men, drugs, and an unyielding food addiction, as well as her relationships with partner Steadman and BFF Gail. As the author&#39;s voice brims with remarkable self-assurance and abundant sarcasm, her delivery has a steady rhythm and a good level of energy. While this highly critical book may surprise people, it most certainly won&#39;t be one of Oprah&#39;s favorite things.

He died in February 2010.*Starred Review* The late Dick Francis, once a champion steeplechase jockey himself, specialized in showing readers racing from behind the scenes and from behind the horses&#x2019; ears, as his early mysteries starred full-time jockeys who sometimes doubled as detectives. Then Francis branched out into sleuthing heroes who were out of the saddle but still connected with the racing world. Felix Francis, Dick Francis&#x2019; son, researcher, collaborator, and, now, mystery-writing successor, continued this racetrack-centered tradition with his first novel, Dick Francis&#x2019;s Gamble (2011). This follow-up stars race announcer and TV presenter Mark Shillingford, whose height eliminated him from his dream of jumping horses early in his career. His twin sister, Clare, however, is flying high as a flat-race jockey&#x2014;Mark often announces the races his sister wins. But something in Clare&#x2019;s latest race bothers Mark; she appears to have drawn the horse up short, deliberately throwing the race. After Mark confronts Clare about this seeming fraud, she leaves abruptly, drives to London, and falls from the roof of a posh hotel. In classic Francis fashion, Mark&#x2019;s life shreds apart as he investigates his sister&#x2019;s death: he&#x2019;s consumed by guilt over Clare&#x2019;s apparent suicide; his girlfriend leaves him; his job is in danger. And then the journalist who defamed his sister after her death is killed at the racetrack. Francis knows how to control this wild run of a plot and also knows how to create a conflicted character in the midst of crisis. A stunning addition to the family line. --Connie Fletcher</p><h2>Brazen Chariots</h2><p><p><strong>"Unquestionably the finest narrative of tank warfare to come out of World War II."&#x2015;<em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong></p> A tank officer's story of the desert war in North Africa, <em>Brazen Chariots</em> is one of the most widely praised war books ever published.

He lives in Beacon, New York.Kindergarten-Grade 3 The words in this story-song flow along with the same ease and naturalness as Seeger's well-known telling on the recording, Abiyoyo and Other Story Songs (Folkways, 1967). There are only minor changes in this version, and the style reflects an oral rather than a literary tradition as Seeger switches from past to present tense in the text. Seeger combines his sense of humor and drama to turn disturbing events to high-spirited fun, as a father and son, turned out by their neighbors as troublemakers, use the very objects that bother peoplethe boy's clinking-clonking ukelele and the father's magic wandto obliviate Abiyoyo, monster on the loose, and so come back into community favor. The tale contains levels of meaning and powerful metaphors for those who choose to pursue them. If Hays' oil-on-linen illustrations are not always successful, it may be that they seem too studied when matched with Seeger's spontaneous, colloquial style. For example, the father is a magician in the simplest sense, yet Hays renders a "magic shop" in the background, with doves, rabbits, silk hatsnot the stuff of most folk tales. In peopling the village, too, he seems to be laboring to make a global statement, surrounding the black boy and his father with people of all races, places, beliefs. His Abiyoyo is a shadowy, looming figure against the blood-red sky, at first a faceless force, growing larger, and finally a towering glaring figure full of terrible witless energy. What is surprising about this Abiyoyo is the lack of earthiness. He is not sinew and muscle, but an automaton with a metallic gleam, the huge overalls he wears seeming an incongruous folksy touch. Still, there are also some very fine illustrations here, and this is a book worthy of attention. It merits a wide audience.

It began very early. I must have been about ten years old, and the memory of that cinema on the rue Legendre in the 17th <i>arrondissement</i> in Paris, with its red velvet seats and its faded gilt, remains astonishingly vivid. A nanny, making the most of my parents' absence, had taken me, and the film that day was <i>L'Affaire du courrier de Lyon</i> [<i>The Courier of Lyons</i>],<i> </i>with Pierre Blanchar and Dita Parlo. I have never known or tried to discover the name of the director, but he must have been very proficient, for there are certain scenes that I have never forgotten: the attack on the Lyon courier's stagecoach in a dark forest, the trial of Lesurques, innocent but condemned to death, the scaffold erected in the middle of a public square, white, as I remember it, the blade swooping down. Back then, as during the Revolution, people were still guillotined in public. For months afterwards, around midnight, I would wake up, terror-stricken, and my father would get up, come into my room, stroke my damp forehead, my hair wet with anxiety, talk to me and calm me. It was not just my head being cut off: sometimes I was guillotined lengthwise, in the way a pit-sawyer cuts wood, or like those astonishing instructions posted on the doors of goods wagons that, in 1914, were used to send men and animals to the front: men 40--horses (lengthwise) 8', and which, after 1941, were used to send Jews to the distant chambers of their final agony. I was being sliced into thin, flat slivers, from shoulder to shoulder, passing through the crown of my head. The violence of these nightmares was such that as a teenager and even as an adult, fearful of reviving them, I superstitiously looked away or closed my eyes whenever a guillotine was depicted in schoolbooks, historical writing or newspapers. I'm not sure that I don't still do so today. In 1938--I was thirteen--the arrest and confession of the German murderer Eugen Weidmann had all of France on tenterhooks. Weidmann had murdered in cold blood, to steal and leave no witnesses, and, without needing to check, I can still remember the names of some of his victims: a dancer, Jean de Koven, a man named Roger Leblond, and others whom he buried in the forest of Fontainebleau, in the aptly named Bois de Fausses-Reposes--the Woods of False Repose. The newsreels, in great detail, showed the investigators searching the coppices, digging up the bodies. Weidmann was condemned to death and guillotined before the prison gate at Versailles in the summer before the war. There are famous photographs of the beheading. Much later I decided to look at them, and did so at length. His was the last public execution in France. Thereafter, the scaffold was erected inside the prison courtyard, until 1981 when, at the instigation of Francois Mitterrand and the then Minister of Justice, Robert Badinter, the death penalty was abolished. But, at thirteen, however, Weidmann, Lanzmann � the identical endings of his name and mine seemed to portend for me some terrible fate. Indeed, as I write these words, even at my supposedly advanced age, there is no guarantee that it will not still be so. The death penalty might be reinstated, all it would take is a change of regime, a vote in parliament, a <i>grande peur</i>. And of course the death penalty survives in many places: to travel is dangerous. I remember discussing it with Jean Genet, because of the dedication of <i>Notre-Dame-des-Fleurs </i>[<i>Our Lady of the Flowers</i>]<i> </i>to a young man, guillotined at the age of twenty--Were it not for Maurice Pilorge, whose death continues to poison my life . . .--and also because Weidmann's name opens the book: Weidmann appeared to you in a five o'clock edition, head swathed in white strips of cloth, a nun and yet a wounded airman . . ., and mentioning my abiding fear that I would die by the so-called <i>bois de justice </i>[the guillotine]. He replied brusquely, There's still time. He was right. He didn't much like me; I felt exactly the same about him.<p></p>I have no neck. I have often wondered, during nocturnal moments of acute bodily awareness spent anticipating the worst, where the blade would have to fall to behead me cleanly. I could think only of my shoulders and my aggressively defensive posture, forged gradually night after night by the nightmares that followed the primal scene of Lesurques' death, which transformed them into a fighting bull's <i>morillo</i>, neck muscles so impenetrable the blade glances off, sending it back to its point of origin, each rebound weakening its original power. It is as though, over time, I had drawn in on myself so as to leave for the blade of <i>la veuve--</i>the widow, as Madame Guillotine is colloquially known--no convenient place and no opportunity for it to make one. In the boxing world, they would say I grew up in a crouch, with a curvature of the torso so marked that an opponent's fists slide off without the punches truly hitting home.<p></p>The truth is that throughout my whole life, and without a moment's respite, the evening before an execution (if I was aware of it, as I frequently was during the Algerian War), and the day after in the case of a non-political capital punishment, were nights and days of distress during which I compelled myself to anticipate or relive the last moments--the hours, the minutes, the seconds--of the condemned men, regardless of the reasons for the fatal verdict. The warders' felt slippers whispering along death row; the sudden clang of cell-door bolts slammed back, the prisoner, haggard, waking with a start, the prosecutor, the lawyer, the chaplain, the be brave, the glass of rum, the handover to the executioner and his aides and the sudden lurch to naked violence, the brutal acceleration of the final sequence: arms lashed behind the back, ankles crudely hobbled with a length of rope, shirt quickly slit with scissors to expose the neck, the prisoner manhandled, shouted at, then hauled, feet dragging along the ground, to the door, now suddenly thrown open, overlooking the machine, standing tall, waiting, in the ashen dawn of the prison courtyard. Yes, I know all these things. With Simone de Beauvoir I would be summoned to the offices of Jacques Verg s around nine o'clock at night where he would inform us that an Algerian was to be executed at dawn in some prison --Fresnes or La Sant&#x17d; in Paris, Oran or Constantine in Algeria � and we would spend the night trying to find someone who might contact someone else, who in turn might dare to disturb the sleep of G&#x17d;n&#x17d;ral de Gaulle, plead with him to spare this poor wretch to whom he had already refused clemency, consciously sending him to the scaffold. At the time, Verg s was head of a collective of lawyers from the <i>Front de lib&#x17d;ration national </i>(FLN) who practised what they called "<i>la defense de rupture</i>", refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the French courts' jurisdiction over the Algerian combatants, which resulted in some of their clients being more speedily dispatched to the guillotine. Very late one night, under the cold eye of Verg s, Le Castor (as Simone de Beauvoir was nicknamed) and I, gripped by the same sense of extreme urgency, managed to reach Francois Mauriac. A man was about to die, he had to be saved, what had been done might yet be undone. Mauriac understood everything, but he also knew that one did not wake de Gaulle and that, in any case, it would make no difference: it was too late, unquestionably. To Verg s, who was well aware of the futility of our attempts, our presence in his offices on the eve of these executions was a political strategy. One to which we consented, given that, from the first, we had militated in favour of Algerian independence, but to me the sense of the irreversible won out over everything else, becoming unbearable as the fatal hour approached. Time divided and negated itself like a gallop seen in slow motion: this scheduled death was endlessly about to take place. As in that space where Achilles can never catch up with the tortoise, so the minutes and seconds were infinitely subdivided, bringing the torment of imminence to its apogee. Verg s, notified of the execution by telephone, put an end to our waiting and in the early hours of morning, in the rain, de Beauvoir and I regularly found ourselves defeated, empty, without any plan, as though the guillotine had also decapitated our future.<p></p>When, in order to demoralize his own people and discourage further plots against him, Hitler ordered that the conspirators of 20 July 1944 be executed one after another, it became clear that the speed at which the executioners would have to work would compromise the precision and the concentration required for the ancient method of beheading by axe, the standard means of capital punishment in Germany. On 22 February 1943, the heroes of <i>die Weisse Rose</i> (the White Rose)--Hans Scholl, his sister Sophie and their friend Christoph Probst--died in their twenties beneath the executioner's axe in Stadelheim Prison, Munich, after a summary trial lasting barely three hours, conducted by the sinister Roland Freisler, the Reich's public prosecutor who had come specially from Berlin. Immediately the verdict was announced, they were put to death in a dungeon in Stadelheim, and Hans, as he laid his head on the block still red with his sister's blood, cried, "Long live freedom!" Even today I cannot call to mind those three handsome, pensive young faces without tears welling in my eyes: the seriousness, the dignity, the determination, the spiritual force, the extraordinary courage of the solitude that emanates from each of them, all speak to their being the best, the honour of Germany, the best of humanity. The 20 July conspirators were the first to die by the German guillotine: unlike its French counterpart--slender, tall and spectacular, lending itself both to being elegantly draped and to literature--the German version is squat, ungainly, four-square, easy to set up in a low-ceilinge...</p><h2>Quick Country Christmas Quilts</h2><p>Provides step-by-step instructions for more than thirty-five Christmas quilt projects, including wall hangings, table accessories, stockings, and ornaments, and offers a scheduling planner to help finish gifts on time</p><p>Celebrate the season with Debbie Mumm's captivating holiday designs!<br><br>Deck the halls with festive quilts, stockings, a coordinated table ensemble, pillows, a tree skirt, ornaments and much, much more.

Every recipe has been tested for success and features advice and tips specifically for that pie. Chapters include: "Berry Good Pies," "Rich, Sweet, and Simple: Chess, Buttermilk, and Other Custard Pies," "Personal Pies, Turnovers, and Other Little Pie Treats," and of course, the foundation chapter, "Pie Pastries and Crumb Crusts."</p></p><p>At 640 pages and nearly two inches thick, <i>Pie</i>, the big book with the shortest possible title, is difficult to read in bed. It's hard to hold up. It weighs on the stomach. But bed is where you will want to take it, night after night, following author Richard Haedrich's lead through fruit pies, berry pies, nut pies, custard pies, turnovers, ice cream pies, and more. Headrich has the most reassuring voice in food literature, and his lifelong passion--the making and baking of all manner of pies--soon begins to fit the reader like new skin. <p> The first 60 pages are given over to general directions (for example, Haedrich is a firm believer in reading a recipe through to completion before lifting a finger; he rolls his dough on wax paper) and the making and shaping of crust. You will find everything you need to know about creating terrific pie crusts including a friendly pat on the back and the sage advice that great crust comes with experience. This is all but permission to bake several pies a week for the rest of your life. The 300 some recipes in <i>Pie</i> will help you on your way. There are 21 crust recipes alone, everything from that perfect flaky crust to Choco-Nut Press-In Pie Crust.</p><p> Ever hear of the Balaton, what sounds like the perfect pie cherry? Haedrich doesn't just give you a cherry pie recipe (there are actually nine), he tells you all about cherries (there's a box titled "Crash Course in Cherries"). And talking about cherries leads to talking about regions of the country, the people in the landscape, the fruit on the trees. You will travel endless miles of back roads with <i>Pie</i>. Haedrich feeds you information in easy bursts, like conversational asides, as recipe leads, as sidebars, as boxes, as how-to notes the author calls "Recipe for Success." In just the pages on cherry pie you'll find out about product sources, sanding sugar, pitting cherries inside plastic bags, lattice pie crusts, baking with kids, knotting cherry stems with your tongue, IQF (individually quick frozen fruit), and much more. And cherry pie isn't a chapter all its own, but a small part of the chapter called Summer Fruit Pies. All told there are 13 chapters in <i>Pie</i>.</p><p> Books like <i>Pie</i> don't happen overnight, or even over a year of nights. Haedrich didn't apply his considerable food writing skill to a subject he simply pulled off the shelf. While the tone may be easy going, there's nothing casual here about either the task or the accomplishment. <i>Pie</i> represents a considerable chunk of one man's life wedged between the covers of a book. The tens of thousands of bits and pieces of valuable information, quotes, lines of poetry, not to mention the recipes and careful instruction comes from years and years of both accumulation and winnowing down to the very best. </p><p> And all along, page after page, there's that implacably friendly, reassuring voice, leading, encouraging, enlightening.

Forstchen, continues the story of a Confederate victory at Gettysburg. The first book examined the great "what if" of American history: Could Lee have won the Battle of Gettysburg? A Confederate victory, however, would not necessarily mean that the Southern cause has gained its final triumph and a lasting peace. It is from this departure point that the story continues in <i>Grant Comes East</i>, as General Robert E. Lee marches on Washington, DC, and launches an assault against one of the largest fortifications in the world.<br><br>Across 140 years, nearly all historians have agreed that after the defeat of the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, the taking of Washington, DC, would end the war. But was it possible?<br>Lee knows that a frontal assault against such fortifications could devastate his army, but it is a price he fears must be paid for final victory. Beyond a military victory in the field, Lee must also overcome the defiant stand of President Abraham Lincoln, who vows that regardless of the defeat at Gettysburg, his solemn pledge to preserve the Union will be honored. Lincoln will mobilize the garrison of Washington to hold on no matter what the costs.<br><br>At the same time, Lincoln has appointed General Ulysses S. Grant as commander of all Union forces. Grant, fresh from his triumph at Vicksburg, races east, bringing with him his hardened veterans from Mississippi to confront Lee.<br><br>What ensues across the next six weeks is a titanic struggle as the surviving Union forces inside the fortifications of Washington fight to hang on, while Grant prepares his counterblow. The defeated Army of the Potomac, staggered by the debacle dealt at Gettysburg, is not yet completely out of the fight, and is slowly reorganizing. Its rogue commander, General Dan Sickles, is thirsting for revenge against Lee, the restoration of the honor of his army, and the fulfillment of his own ambitions, which reach all the way to the White House. All these factors will come together in a climatic struggle spanning the ground from Washington, through Baltimore, to the banks of the Susquehanna River.<br><br>Once again, Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen create a brilliant story of how the Civil War could have unfolded. In <i>Grant Comes East</i>, they use their years of research and expertise to take readers on an incredible journey.<br><br></p><p>Praise for <i>Gettysburg</i><br><br>"Well-executed alternative history.

As an alternative history of Gettysburg, it stands alone. The mastery of operational history enables the authors to expand the story's scope. The larger-scale, more fluid battle of Gettysburg described is internally consistent, a logical consequence of the novel's challenging major premise.

I suspect you may find that something of the starry magic of this story stays with you, as it has with me." &#x2014; Gregory Maguire </p><p>"A lovely story...which covers a poetic, yearning philosophy&#x2014;not the sort of fable that can be tacked down neatly at its four corners but rather reflections on what are real matters of consequence." &#x2014; <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>At first glance, Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry&#x2019;s 1943 classic <i>The Little Prince</i>&#x2014;with its winsome illustrations of a boy prince and his tiny planet&#x2014;appears to be a children&#x2019;s fairy tale. It doesn&#x2019;t take long, however, to discover that it speaks to readers of all ages. This pocket-sized edition, perfect for teens, features Saint-Exup�ry&#x2019;s original full-color illustrations and the unabridged text, a reader&#x2019;s guide, and a introduction by Gregory Maguire. Rediscover&#x2014;or share&#x2014;the magic! </p><p>This title has been selected as a Common Core Text Exemplar (Grades 4-5, Stories).</p></p><p>Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry first published <i>The Little Prince</i> in 1943, only a year before his Lockheed P-38 vanished over the Mediterranean during a reconnaissance mission. More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. "In the face of an overpowering mystery, you don't dare disobey," the narrator recalls. "Absurd as it seemed, a thousand miles from all inhabited regions and in danger of death, I took a scrap of paper and a pen out of my pocket." And so begins their dialogue, which stretches the narrator's imagination in all sorts of surprising, childlike directions.<p> The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exup�ry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too. There's the king, for example, who commands the Little Prince to function as a one-man (or one-boy) judiciary: </p><blockquote> I have good reason to believe that there is an old rat living somewhere on my planet. I hear him at night. You could judge that old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. That way his life will depend on your justice. But you'll pardon him each time for economy's sake. There's only one rat. </blockquote> The author pokes similar fun at a businessman, a geographer, and a lamplighter, all of whom signify some futile aspect of adult existence. Yet his tale is ultimately a tender one--a heartfelt exposition of sadness and solitude, which never turns into <i>Peter Pan</i>-style treacle. Such delicacy of tone can present real headaches for a translator, and in her 1943 translation, Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard (who did a fine nip-and-tuck job on Stendhal's <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> in 1999) has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect. The result is a new and improved version of an indestructible classic, which also restores the original artwork to full color. "Trying to be witty," we're told at one point, "leads to lying, more or less." But Saint-Exup�ry's drawings offer a handy rebuttal: they're fresh, funny, and like the book itself, rigorously truthful. <i>--James Marcus</i>First published in 1943<br>Previous hardcover edition 2000<br>0-15-202398-4<br></p><h2>Clinical Observations Of Children&#39;s Remedies</h2><p>The book Clinical Observations of Childrens Remedies is the outcome of 23 years of experience of Dr Farokh J.

The symptoms in this book are not like a standard materia medica based on proving but they are based purely on experience and clinical observation of the author. 76 remedies are discussed in detail in this book. Each remedy is divided under two main heads; identifying features and other important symptoms which inturn are divided into mental and physical symptoms. Mental symptoms are put under identifying features as it is easy to understand a child by his striking mental traits. These symptoms are extracted from the psycho analysis of children, family pattern, state of mind of mother during pregnancy, labor lactation etc. other important symptoms contain clinical and pathological data including physical examination and investigatory findings.

Together they would build something deemed impossible: a modern utopia in the wilderness �&#x20ac;&#x201d; but not before Arsene falls in love with his cousin�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s wife, Marieke. Whether delirious from love or a fever-inducing jungle virus, Arsene�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s loosening grip on reality is mirrored by the graphic novel reader�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s uncertainty of what is imagined or real by Arsene.</p><p>Olivier Schrauwen was born in Belgium in 1977 and studied animation at the Academy of Art in Gent, and comics at the Saint Luc in Brussels. He currently lives in Berlin.&#x201c;...<em>Arsene Schrauwen</em> is one of the most complex, and simply best, comics released this year. ...[It] uses simplified drawings, collage-like text and two colors (red and blue) to convey a narrative that moves between the real and the fantastic with grace and facility.

Schrauwen&#x2019;s off-the-wall ode to his grandfather&#x2019;s life, love, and virus-induced mental walkabout -- rendered in burnt orange and cornflower blue -- is artistically simple but deeply symbolic.

His project kicked off a half century of research that has expanded our knowledge of climate change. Despite more than fifty years of research, however, our global society has yet to find real solutions to the problem of global warming. Why?<br><br>In <i>Behind the Curve</i>, Joshua Howe attempts to answer this question. He explores the history of global warming from its roots as a scientific curiosity to its place at the center of international environmental politics. The book follows the story of rising CO2&#x2015;illustrated by the now famous Keeling Curve&#x2015;through a number of historical contexts, highlighting the relationships among scientists, environmentalists, and politicians as those relationships changed over time.<br><br>The nature of the problem itself, Howe explains, has privileged scientists as the primary spokespeople for the global climate. But while the &#x201c;science first&#x201d; forms of advocacy they developed to fight global warming produced more and better science, the primacy of science in global warming politics has failed to produce meaningful results. In fact, an often exclusive focus on science has left advocates for change vulnerable to political opposition and has limited much of the discussion to debates about the science itself.<br><br>As a result, while we know much more about global warming than we did fifty years ago, CO2 continues to rise. In 1958, Keeling first measured CO2 at around 315 parts per million; by 2013, global CO2 had soared to 400 ppm. The problem is not getting better - it's getting worse. <i>Behind the Curve</i> offers a critical and levelheaded look at how we got here.</p><p><p>In <i>Behind the Curve</i>, Joshua Howe explores the history of global warming from its roots as a scientific curiosity to its place at the center of international environmental politics.</p><b>Joshua P.

Perhaps this is because Seymour is a professional astronomer (Plymouth Polytechnic Institute, England) who's aware that he tiptoes on professional quicksand, edging into a region toward which most scientists demonstrate ``an appalling lapse in...understanding.'' He circles his goal warily, by laying down what is known about bio-cycles and the environment; most of this is schoolbook primer, although Seymour slips in some zingers--for instance, that early humans knew how to use earth's magnetic field for navigation, or that the Star of Bethlehem was actually a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. Finally, he leaves his astronomical colleagues in the dust, outlining his theory of extraterrestrial influence--in a nutshell, that planets affect solar cycles, which in turn affect earth's geomagnetic fields, which in turn affect human fetal development. A neat theory, currently unprovable (although the recent discovery of micromagnets in the human brain gives it credence). The spirit of Michel Gauquelin, pioneer of the ``scientific'' defense of astrology, hovers over this book (which is dedicated to him, contains an afterword about him, and has the same title as Gauquelin's classic). As such, it's as down-to-earth as such starry-eyed productions get. (Diagrams throughout.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Seymour brings cosmology and astrology together to determine the relationship between living organisms and their physical environment. He discusses the effects of seasonal weather changes and the resulting temperature responses in animals and humans. Early humans, he posits, may have used planetary movement as well as the geomagnetic field of the earth for navigational purposes on land and sea. As people moved from living in small bands to larger groups, mechanical means of time-keeping such as calendars and clocks became necessary. Later, transportation developments also caused a need for the uniformity of time. Seymour also debates the theories of Michel Gauquelin and Suitbert Ertel, both of whom studied the effects of planetary positions at the time of an individual's birth and their correlation to human behavior. This is an intriguing if inconclusive book by a prominent British astronomer. An optional purchase.<br><i>- Lisa Wise, Three Rivers Lib.

When he died in 1989 of AIDS, at the age of forty-two, he was considered one of the most important photographers of his generation, having gained a reputation as the avatar of a rigorous formalism stunningly wed to graphic and sometimes controversial subject matter.<br><br>Most of Robert Mapplethorpe's days began in the early afternoon, often by photographing flowers. Mapplethorpe used them to help focus his vision, centering and warming up for his commercial portrait work. The flowers also helped him to effect the transition to the more daring work, which he executed late at night.<br><br><b>Pistils</b> reproduces 120 of these ravishing images of flowers, many of which have never been published. The full range of Mapplethorpe's virtuosity is displayed here--early Polaroids: exacting still lifes in black-and-white and color; and extremely rare, toned gravure prints. Not since Georgia O'Keeffe has an artist looked at flowers with as developed an eye as Robert Mapplethorpe. In them he discovered sex, death, redemption, and, always, beauty. These photographs go far beyond decorative allure to place him firmly in the pantheon of the photographic masters.</p><p>Robert Mapplethorpe was born in Queens, New York in 1946. He studied at the Pratt Institute, working primarily in printmaking and as a filmmaker. He began to take photographs, at first mainly Polaroids, while living with the singer Patti Smith in the Chelsea Hotel. Mapplethorpe had his first one-man exhibition in New York in 1976. He became known for his portraits of friends and acquaintances, among them artists, composers, architects, socialites, stars of pornographic films, and members of the homosexual underground. His photographs of flowers and of nude black men were also widely praised. In 1988 the Whitney Museum of American Art mounted the first major retrospective of Mapplethorpe&#39;s work. Mapplethorpe died the following year, and an exhibition of his photographs organized by the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia led to debate over public support of the arts.Though Mapplethorpe (1946-89) may figure in the public consciousness for his controversial X Portfolio, his strong reputation in art circles is grounded on his stark formalism, his celebrity portraits, and his photographs of flowers. Indeed, the flowers consistently outpace all his other works at the annual auctions. This third volume in Random House's collaboration with the Mapplethorpe Foundation (after Mapplethorpe, 1990, and Altars, LJ 2/1/96) conveys the luminosity and seductive beauty of 120 of Mapplethorpe's creations in amazingly rich reproductions. A short but insightful essay by poet Ashbery delves into the artist's uneasy relation to his floral subjects and places them within his greater oeuvre. Mapplethorpe photographed flowers throughout his career, and the images here represent all periods and styles, including color and toned prints. The book's only drawback is the editors' choice to present the pictures out of chronological order, forcing the reader to flip back and forth to discern shifts in the artist's manipulations of light and depth. Still, with twice as many illustrations as Bulfinch's Flowers (LJ 12/90), which showed only color works, this sumptuous book belongs in all academic and most larger public libraries.?Eric Bryant, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Smash Trash!
